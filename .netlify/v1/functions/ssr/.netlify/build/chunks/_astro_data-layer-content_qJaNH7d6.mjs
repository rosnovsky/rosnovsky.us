So, this one is from the time when we just moved to America from Canada and decided to treat ourselves to a helicopter ride. Apparently, helicopter rides are **expensive**. A 15-minute ride for a family of 3 cost us a few hundred dollars. Well, I thought it was ridiculous and an outrage, and decided to go to take some piloting lessons to be able to take my family on such trips whenever I want, 5-10 times cheaper. It didn’t work out exactly the way I wanted, but I did indeed had a great time flying with them in Nevada and along the Columbia River.\n\nHere’s a video from this historic helicopter ride along the Oregon coast.\n\n<YouTube id=\"rpSmobOhiVQ\" className=\"mx-auto min-w-full\" />\n\nSeaside Helicopters is one of the only companies offering helicopter tours along the Pacific coast in Oregon. They are based off of a small amusement park just east of Seaside. You can’t really miss them: there’s a billboard, and their helicopter idling by the side of the road, hard to miss as well. The service they provide is professional, courteous, and focused on safety. For example, your weight might prevent you from taking the tour (I don’t remember exactly, but it’s something like 250 lbs tops per person). The weather could prevent you from flying as well, but being a pilot myself (albeit a student pilot), I really like this saying:\n\n> **All takeoffs are optional, all landings are mandatory**\n\nBasically, you’re 100% in control to take off or not. However, if you make a bad choice and fly in poor conditions, you will land, one way or the other. We were lucky, and the weather was amazing for our booking date, so we enjoyed the tour a lot. Pilots comment on what you see, point out where things are, and give you a certain freedom to decide where to go and what to see. All in all, we enjoyed the experience, even though, as I mentioned before, it cost us something in the ballpark of $300 for a 15-minute tour for two adults and a child.","src/content/blog/2013/08/26/seaside-helicopters.mdx",[35],"8ee09a164652af38","2013/08/26/seaside-helicopters.mdx",true,"2018/08/01/20-minute-bike-commute-in-5-minutes",{id:69,data:71,body:77,filePath:78,assetImports:79,digest:80,rendered:81,legacyId:89},{title:72,image:73,category:74,description:75,publishDate:76},"20-minute bike commute in 5 minutes",{src:22,alt:23},"Personal","Biking!!!",["Date","2018-08-01T00:00:00.000Z"],"In [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9tx6BbOFEc), I’m riding my [RadCity](https://www.radpowerbikes.com/products/radcity-electric-commuter-bike) eBike with pedal-assist system from home to work.

So here goes.\n\nThis year my I signed up my son for school football. He’s in his last year of middle school, and had never participated in sports before. He had a encounter with Taekwando years ago, which at that point was more of a daycare then a sport for him. They had all kinds of fun, including belt promotions and demonstrations, but he really struggled with instructions, discipline and so forth. Overall, it was deemed not worth it after almost a year, and our annual contract with the club quietly expired.\n\nThis year I decided that he’s old enough to actually enjoy a team sport. He’d never been a part of a team outside of occasional group projects at school, and I was wondering if this whole football experience could brighten up he’s social experiences, not that he has any problems socializing at school or otherwise.\n\nSo, I signed him up for football practice. My expectation and hope was that he will at least move a little after school on occasion, and I hoped that he’d get to run least a little, maybe learn how to throw a ball, perhaps, learn the rules of the game so that watching it would be more enjoyable for him. Remember, I had no clue what this school football is, and thought about it more as of general exercise than an actual playing experience. Boy was I wrong!\n\nFirst shock was that he actually got a uniform. 3 sets, in fact: for training, for home games, and for away games. Then I discovered that they practice every day, not, like, once or twice a week, as I thought previously. And on top of that, they actually play against other schools, every week, starting with the second week of practice! Say what now?! And so my very never-played-sports-before son is now a football player. He knows his position, know the routes, can actually run them, can catch a ball. He doesn’t really play that much during games against other schools — 5-10 plays tops, but he gets to go on the field, face the opposing team, do the whole routine. And I find it extremely cool! I’ve been to every game he had so far, and some of them were so heated, close, and exciting!\n\n## Some random observations\n\nWhen a player gets injured, whether he’s from your team or not, every other player on the field takes a knee and waits for the situation to resolve. During this season, I’ve seen this happen three times; none of them were actual injuries, but the whole routine still impressed me nonetheless.\n\n> As a side note, it’s a contact sport, and as with any sport, there’s always a chance of being hit or fall or twist your ankle; with this being said, it looks like safety is one of the top concern for the coaches and the officials, and the kids are trained to keep other’s safety in mind as well\n\nTeam building is a big deal.\n\n<YouTube id=\"eU0QK50Tw-s\" className=\"mx-auto min-w-full\" />\n\nLosing on a play, fumbling a ball, throwing an interception — and immediately moving on to the next play. No fuming, no regrets, no time for that, next play! This is kinda cool, really. Same goes for games lost: yes, it’s an “L”, **go home, do your homework, spend time with your family, see you tomorrow at practice**.\n\nHomework, yes. There’s a grade check process in place. If you get below a certain threshold, you are suspend form participation in games (you still can go to practice, though). Vlad did fall below this threshold for a week, and missed a game. He got super motivated to get back in the game and spend that whole week making up for things he failed in class, make-up tests, working on big projects and such.\n\nAll in all, I think signing him up for football practice was one of the best decisions we made as parents. Not only did he met new friends, had this team experience, ran around quite a bit, learned how to catch a ball, and played some pretty real football games, he also discovered new things about himself as a person and got some extra motivation at school.\n\nAnd the funniest part is that 10 years ago we didn’t know football existed, and it’s only been 4 years since we watched a game for the first time :)","src/content/blog/2018/10/21/middle-school-football.mdx",[35],"7ccfd55d3543dfca","2018/10/21/middle-school-football.mdx","2018/11/02/on-reading",{id:103,data:105,body:111,filePath:112,assetImports:113,digest:114,rendered:115,legacyId:124},{title:106,image:107,category:108,description:109,publishDate:110},"On Reading",{src:22,alt:23},"Books","Definition of reading is evolving.",["Date","2018-11-02T00:00:00.000Z"],"We all read a lot without even giving it a second thought.

The actual issue is that as a result of such reading overload we generally read way fewer books, then we used to.\n\nWhy does it even matter? I read a tutorial on [how to run my own home email server](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2014/02/how-to-run-your-own-e-mail-server-with-your-own-domain-part-1/), a bunch of articles about hiking ([Guide to hiking the PCT](https://www.pcta.org/take-a-hike/) or [The benefits of hiking alone](https://www.rei.com/blog/hike/benefits-hiking-alone)), an endless thread on reddit surrounding use of semicolons, a bunch of quick bits on Stack Overflow, and I’ve just plowed through like 40 pages of text before lunch. Isn’t it enough? Well, **in my book**, this is a lot of reading, but it’s a different kind of reading, and it’s not a substitute for books. Here’s why.\n\nBooks are deliberate, well-structured, well-written, thoroughly edited, spell-checked and fact-checked blocks of consumable knowledge, that with any luck unpack so much over the course of just a few hundred pages. That’s the beauty of a book: it’s designed to provide significant amount of carefully composed knowledge. If it’s a fiction book, we are talking about a great story that puts you into this different world, paints it in such vivid colors and in such detail, that you swear you could smell the biscuits and see a sparkle of ice in gardeners eyes (he’s the murderer!), or whatever.\n\nWhen someone tries to make a book into a movie, it takes great effort to convey whatever there was in the book in a 2-hour film. Because you can’t unpack a good story in such a short period of time! You can’t get an experience of the whole world so quickly, and rightly so! It takes time to read a book, the process is deliberate; it takes effort, it takes experience, it takes work. And you need all this time to process and make this experience your own.\n\nI love reading. It takes time, so I listen to books on my commute whenever I can’t squeeze them into my day. And I can’t describe how awesome it is that people write books! There’s a book sometimes called “A Petition Book” (although “A Complaint Book” would certainly suit it better) by a a Russian fantasy writer Max Frei (pen name), where the main character has the ability to live and enjoy lives of those who complain or whine about their lives. These people don’t realize that someone just experienced their whole future lives without changing them, and all they have left is these same lives but dialed-down. The main character never physically leaves the place of the encounter; he just spends years and years of his “victim’s” life and “returns” it back, gently used: victim’s future emotions will not be as sharp, and their experiences will be bleak and dull, but they will never know the difference. It seems to me, that whenever one enjoys a good book, he or she gets to experience someone else’s life in the same manner, adding years and years of emotions, knowledge, experience and joy to their own life, but without any side effects.\n\nSo, for me, reading is a lot like living an extra life, that belongs to a different person. How cool is that? It’s not necessarily a better life, but it sure is different. Can you say that reading a good blog post or an extensive tutorial is something something along those lines?

I do this 100% voluntarily, because believe it or not, I enjoy my job. I don’t have to be here, I don’t have to come to the office every day or even most days, but I do nonetheless. Because I like it, it brings me joy, I have fun, I learn, my team is awesome, and I get free granola and coffee :)\n\nHowever, I’m old enough to realize that this sort of pace is not sustainable long-term. People get burnt out at the most fantastic dream jobs; their families suffer, friendships fall apart, even while their careers soar and they enjoy every moment of their work life. We all need breaks, even from the most fulfilling activities.\n\nSo… Breaks, huh? Something to take your mind off work, daily tasks, goals, OKRs, KPIs, or what have you. People do all sorts of different things: they hike, they travel, read books at their favorite coffee shops, hang out with friends, watch TV, eat out, draw, make podcasts, brew beer, learn pottery, or how to fly an airplane. The list is endless, and most people find something enjoyable to do besides work.\n\nI’d most definitely go on an overnight solo hike this summer. I will absolutely fly a helicopter this summer at least once. It’s very likely that I’m going to visit friends in Portland in late July or August. I have a list of books I want to read, and I most certainly will.\n\nAs fun as they are, these activities are not of the “all-consuming” kind. They are a bunch of events, not a continuous process. Even though you could fill your life with these activities, they are fleeting. That’s why I’m embarking on this project I want to talk about.\n\nYou may or may not have heard about [750words.com](https://750words.com/). It’s a service that allows you to type 750 words a day. Any words, just let your thoughts flow. I loved it in the past, and still thinks it’s therapeutic value cannot be overestimated. Unfortunately, it hasn’t been updating recently, and I thought what if I make my own service of this kind?

I worked last Saturday as well and will be working tomorrow too. I do this 100% voluntarily, because believe it or not, I enjoy my job. I don’t have to be here, I don’t have to come to the office every day or even most days, but I do nonetheless. Because I like it, it brings me joy, I have fun, I learn, my team is awesome, and I get free granola and coffee :)</p>\n<p>However, I’m old enough to realize that this sort of pace is not sustainable long-term. People get burnt out at the most fantastic dream jobs; their families suffer, friendships fall apart, even while their careers soar and they enjoy every moment of their work life. We all need breaks, even from the most fulfilling activities.</p>\n<p>So… Breaks, huh? Something to take your mind off work, daily tasks, goals, OKRs, KPIs, or what have you. People do all sorts of different things: they hike, they travel, read books at their favorite coffee shops, hang out with friends, watch TV, eat out, draw, make podcasts, brew beer, learn pottery, or how to fly an airplane. The list is endless, and most people find something enjoyable to do besides work.</p>\n<p>I’d most definitely go on an overnight solo hike this summer. I will absolutely fly a helicopter this summer at least once. It’s very likely that I’m going to visit friends in Portland in late July or August. I have a list of books I want to read, and I most certainly will.</p>\n<p>As fun as they are, these activities are not of the “all-consuming” kind. They are a bunch of events, not a continuous process. Even though you could fill your life with these activities, they are fleeting. That’s why I’m embarking on this project I want to talk about.</p>\n<p>You may or may not have heard about <a href=\"https://750words.com/\">750words.com</a>. It’s a service that allows you to type 750 words a day. Any words, just let your thoughts flow. I loved it in the past, and still thinks it’s therapeutic value cannot be overestimated. Unfortunately, it hasn’t been updating recently, and I thought what if I make my own service of this kind?

I got this bike in mid-February, and a couple of days after that I broke my stupid right leg at the knee. I was unable to stand on my own or walk without a walker until late April, and only in mid-May I was cleared to use my both legs for walking sans crutches. I still can’t really walk well or far: I limp heavily, I can only go really slowly, walking is still very difficult for me, and walking a mile is still out of the question (it gets better every week, though; I workout, do physical therapy and such).\n\nSo two weeks ago I decided to give biking a shot. I mean, what could possibly go wrong, amirite? :) Last week I managed to build on that initial success, and this week I took it all to a whole new level! Not only did I commute to work this week (once, but still), but I also overcame some of my fears and rode the bike to the nearby city to get it all tuned-up and adjusted — an almost 30-mile round trip. This is by far the farthest I’ve ever traveled by a bicycle in my entire life. It gave me this amazing sense of freedom, when you sorta “walk”-travel: you enjoy the scenery, all the forest smells, sunshine and rain (I’ve got both today!), you breathe fresh air, listen to you favorite podcasts, and workout, while actually going places at the same time! It’s just the absolutely best thing!\n\nNow, my bike is an eBike. It has a battery, a motor and it has 5-level Pedal Assist Systems (PAS) along with a throttle. One can use this bike without pedaling at all, or without any assistance from the motor. I’m doing something in-between: I use PAS at about level 2, and I use throttle to start faster at traffic lights. It means, that while I pedal pretty hard, I get some help from the motor, especially going uphill, and I use the motor to start faster after I come to a complete stop at an intersection or such. In this mode, the battery lasts for about 40 miles, it seems. And since I track my rides with Apple Watch, I get a pretty accurate estimate of my physical effort (hint: it’s not insignificant)\n\nSo although, in a way, it is not a “pure” biking experience, I must say, if it wasn’t for the motor, I would probably never get into biking at all considering all the hills we have here and my poor physical shape.

In February 2010, I was probably sitting in my apartment in Moscow, minding my own business, having dinner with family, or maybe a coffee with friends. 10 years later, I work in a completely different industry, I’m live in a different country on another continent, I’m 60 lbs heavier, 1 inch taller (!), and have 80% more gray hair. I also like to think that I’m much wiser than 10 years ago, but life has its on ways of proving me wrong on this again and again :)\n\nHere’s a quick look at the past decade and a look beyond 2020.\n\n## 2010\n\n### Radio\n\nI started the decade as a radio personality. I was an editor of a few popular radio shows back Moscow. I also popped on air myself every now and again, and I mostly enjoyed it, and couldn’t really imagine myself doing anything else.\n\nHowever, by 2010 it was clear to me that my birth country is heading in a direction incompatible with my values. It’s been pretty clear for a while, and ever since 2006 my family was low key looking at our immigration options. In 2010 I came up with a plan, and started working on implementation.\n\n### Canada\n\nIn fall 2010 I visited London, Ontario, Canada. I toured local schools, exploring programs I could take. At the time, Canada offered a pretty generous immigration path through education, and that was the plan.\n\nI’m eternally grateful to my friends in London for making this trip possible. This trip kicked-off the decade of adventure and change. After coming back home and discussing with the family, we came up with an action plan to move to Canada by fall 2011.\n\n## 2011\n\n### First Immigration\n\nOn August 20, 2011 we left Russia with 3 suitcases and some carry-on, and 11 hours later landed in Toronto, Canada. Our wonderful friends drove us to London, our new home. Later that year I started Multimedia Design and Production program at Fanshawe. I’ve been doing some tech stuff all my life, but this time it was official: I had proper programming classes and projects.\n\nThese were exciting times of discovering a new country, new way of life, new industry. We fell in love with Canada, Southwestern Ontario, Toronto, and everything around. These were challenging times too: we had very limited resources, no family around, school was challenging, overall adaptation to the new reality wasn’t always easy.\n\n## 2012\n\nOn May 1, 2012 my wife won a Diversity Visa (“green card lottery”), which granted us permanent residency in America. We considered it for a few hours, and chose to go through with the process and move to the United States. In December we got our visas, and landed as permanent residents on December 30, 2012 via Buffalo, NY.\n\nIn 2012 I also joined a small software project, which introduced me to software development and allowed to sustain the family for a few years.\n\n## 2013\n\n### Second Immigration\n\nWe stayed in Canada until I finished college, and moved to Vancouver, WA in May 2013. Initially, we were considering Grand Rapids, MI, but after a quick trip to Portland, OR, it became an obvious choice. We packed our apartment into a UBox, hopped on a plane and landed in PDX a few hours later. We’ve been living in the Pacific Northwest ever since.\n\n## 2014\n\nWe started 2014 in Las Vegas on our Big California Trip. We flew in a single-engine airplane over Hoover Dam. I was a student pilot, recording over 50 hours of flight time, including a few amazing solo flights over the Cascades. We traveled a lot, exploring Oregon, Washington, Pacific Coast, the mountains, and everything this incredible region has to offer.\n\n## 2015\n\nIn 2015 we bought our first house and settled into our quite suburban life. Arguably, it was a bit too quite at times, so we traveled a lot and had some fun along the way.\n\nWe’ve got our kittens, Trish and Dice!\n\nI also was performed my first solo flight as a pilot of a single engine airplane!\n\n## 2016\n\nThis was arguably one of the toughest years of the decade. A lot has changed, and we had to adapt to our new reality very quickly. I’d say we did a pretty good job.\n\nOne of the highlights of the years was our trip to the East Coast - DC & NY and spending 2 weeks with my parents there!\n\nIn December, I started working as a contractor at Intel. It was my first non-self-employment job in America.\n\n## 2017\n\n2017 was a year of most change since our last immigration.\n\nIn 2017 I became an uncle.\n\nIn 2017 We sold a house in Vancouver and moved to Seattle area.\n\nIn 2017 I started working as a contractor at AT&T.\n\nAs always, we traveled a lot.\n\nIn 2017 Chester Bennington of Linkin Park died of suicide. We had tickets to their show later that year, and it was difficult to contain our excitement about this upcoming concert.\n\nWe organized a memorial in Centennial Park in Seattle.\n\n## 2018\n\nThe year of Broken Leg. I broke my leg in February and this event defined pretty much the rest of the year.\n\nIn September, my contract with AT&T ended, and I picked up a 5-month project with a small company out of Kent.\n\nParents visited us in the fall, and it was one of the highlights of the year.\n\nFinally, this happened:\n\n## 2019\n\n2019 was a year of re-evaluating where I’m going and where I want to go. A year of being more true to myself than ever before. A year of strategic decisions and steps. The year of righting the wrongs, a year of self-care, inner peace and progress.\n\nIn May I picked up a 5-month project at Microsoft. It was a fun ride, I learned a lot an met some cool people. I believe that it paved the way for the next chapter of my life.\n\nIn December, after the most deliberate and exhaustive job hunt I’ve ever performed, I [landed a job at Auth0](/blog/new-job/). It is as close to dream job as it gets, and I’ve got pretty high hopes here :)\n\n## 2020 and beyond\n\nI enter this new decade with a lot of baggage that will require taking care of. Some things will be left behind for good, some will manifest themselves in unexpected ways. I will keep working on my mental health, family relationships, building new strong friendships and working on straightening old ones. A lot of work is ahead, and I’m hopeful and optimistic.\n\nHere’s to the new decade!

Whenever we work on weekends, we can then take a day off during the week. Well, today was the day, and I forgot about it.\n\nI’m not entirely sure what it means. Probably, that I’m less organized than I thought previously, or maybe I still don’t think about my work as a **joby-job**; I come to work, we hang out tackling things and battling all sorts of uncertainties, figure out stuff together and on our own, recreate apps, reproduce bugs, troubleshoot the unknown, stretch (!), drink coffee and go back home whenever we feel like it to keep doing all these things remotely. (sounds good? Join us, [we are hiring](https://jobs.lever.co/auth0?lever-via=KkPp8EXnYD)!)\n\nIs it my passion to do all this? For sure. But is it my **PASSION**? Nope.

I don’t want to reconcile what I enjoy passionately with what I do for work, or with who I am. I am all the things I love and all the things I do and say.

Normally, I don't play video games, casually or otherwise. However, from time to time I enjoy certain titles. I loved **Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 4**, spent countless hours playing **Max Payne 2**, **Portal** (1 & 2), **GTA 2**, **Doom**, an assortment of **Need for Speed** games. I played **Factorio** for a while; I absolutely love **Sayonara Wild Hearts** and played a ton of **Asphalt** 8 and 9. This is a more or less complete history of my relationship with video games. So when I say that I consider **Ori and the Blind Forest** to be the greatest game of all time, take it with a grain of salt.\n\n## Ori and the Blind Forest\n\nThe original Ori was a revelation. It's stunningly beautiful, the story is gentle and touching, the characters are relatable, the world of Nibel makes sense, the music is absolutely breathtakingly beautiful, and the controls are easy to learn. This game quickly became our family's favorite; we played it for months, and then played it again and again. After \"The Definitive Edition\" came out, we played it as well, more than once. In 2017 the studio behind Ori announced a sequel, Ori and the Will of the Wisps, and I couldn't have been more excited about it! A new adventure of Ori and his friends in a magical world of mesmerizing beauty and immersive music! I'd followed the development and new announcements very closely, and after quite a few delays, the game came out in March 2020.\n\nI was thrilled! A friend helped me get a copy of the game right away, and I've ordered the [Collector's Edition](https://amzn.to/2KLKZ2R) as soon as it became available.\n\nAnd then everything fell apart...\n\n![](https://cdn.sanity.io/images/n3o7a5dl/prod/20cd1416a9bb05e0de5f8abfbe76330a2e9f8090-1200x675.jpg)\n\n## Ori and the Will of the Wisps\n\nFirst, without any reservations, **Ori and the Will of the Wisps** is absolutely fantastic. It's unbelievably beautiful, and every frame, every scene is a true gem. The details are just beyond anything I've ever seen on a TV screen. The spirit and overall atmosphere of the game is truly captivating.\n\n![](https://cdn.sanity.io/images/n3o7a5dl/prod/e6f2fafe5f089de05aa42e3be50ce6a289d9faad-1920x1080.jpg)\n\nMusic... It's otherworldly. It just takes you away in a swirl of themes and you just float there, weightless and enchanted. My descriptions don't do OST justice it deserves. Here, enjoy!\n\n[The main theme rhymes a lot with the original Ori soundtrack](https://soundcloud.com/garethcokerofficial/main-theme-1)\n\nThe story... It makes sense. It's a logical follow-up to the Blind Forest. We've met all the characters before, we know their backstory and what they went through to arrive here. We know their previous struggles, and we are presented with a new challenge in a captivating intro. Right away, we get a feel of the new Ori world — so familiar yet new and exciting!\n\nAnd then the struggle begins. This is purely subjective personal opinion of a non-gamer with limited console experience (well, limited to the previous Ori game, really).\n\n## Controls\n\nControls are impossible to remember. Original Ori was introducing new control options throughout the game. All the way to the very end you were gently trained on how to use certain abilities, how to do various tricks. By the end of the game, you were using every button of a controller and you got there naturally. In the Will of the Wisps, you're thrown right in, and just a few minutes into the game you have to assign different actions to different buttons, shuffle abilities and their combinations and constantly keep it all in mind as you go. The learning curve just cannot be any steeper. I'm sure it's not an issue for someone who plays a lot, but it's a showstopper for a casual gamer. And it's a significant change from the original Ori. This alone made the **Will of the Wisps** if not entirely unplayable for me, but extremely challenging and very difficult if not impossible to enjoy.\n\n## Gameplay\n\nWhat happened with a straightforward, logical, easy to follow story? Who are these people Ori has to interact with constantly? Why all these side quests? What's with a slew of \"currencies\" you need to collect? Merchants? What's going on?! Not only it's difficult to control the character, but the game is now constantly interrupted by a crowd of random needy characters, who constantly make you do stuff. It feels so besides the main storyline, and much more difficult to follow what's going on, what's next, and why you're doing all these quests. Again, I understand that for gamers it's probably a new and exciting development, but for a casual player, it's just beyond confusing.\n\n## Achievements and Abilities\n\nThis was the last straw. There are like 5 screens of different types of achievements, abilities, collectible items, tokes, coins, a variety of energy points, combinations of different things. I just couldn't follow it all. What goes where? Do I need more tokens, icons, coins, or keys? How do I get each, and where do I spend it? Do I exchange tokens for abilities or energy? Unsurprisingly, all of this made it definitively impossible to keep playing the game.\n\n![](https://cdn.sanity.io/images/n3o7a5dl/prod/d6dc9ac7a750fd86be6527bfa71bc0fbc4ce0d4b-1920x1080.jpg)\n\nAs much as I loved **Ori and the Blind Forest**, I just can't play **Ori and the Will of the Wisps**. It's way too complicated, convoluted, overly complex, full of interruptions, and non-linear intermissions. It's way more work and effort. It's not a smooth flow that just takes you along with the story, it's a struggle to keep up with controls, track resources, managing abilities, and purchase achievements.\n\nIt makes me very sad. I understand that the **Will of the Wisps** is an upgrade in every sense of the word, but it clearly is geared to attract more hardcore gamers. I totally understand this, and I don't blame the studio for trying to capture this audience. But for me... I'm just left out. The new Ori is here, but I can no longer enjoy it. I will probably watch a video walk-through, and would still probably enjoy it, but it's not something I'm looking forward to. One of the best games ever made is no longer accessible to those who loved the original for its simplicity.\n\nOh, well.

However, there are some silver linings there, and one of them I mentioned earlier in a [post about staying entertained during Covid-19](/blog/entertainment-in-times-of-covid-19/): tech conferences moving online. Not only that but as a result of increased accessibility, we are getting exposed to a wide and fantastic variety of speakers from across the globe. Every conference now can have any speaker at any time!\n\n[Entertainment in times of Covid-19](/blog/entertainment-in-times-of-covid-19/)\n\n[**Byteconf**](https://www.bytesized.xyz/conference) is an online native. Run by [**Bytesized**](https://www.bytesized.xyz/), they've been doing online-only conferences for years now. These conferences are free to watch and participate, and usually bring together a pretty awesome lineup of speakers. This year's **Byteconf React 2020** was no exception.\n\n[Byteconf React 2020 - May 1, 2020](https://www.byteconf.com/)\n\nOne of the most impressive things I want to mention is production quality. The whole stream looked super slick, intermissions and music were spot-on, and talks just flowed. Pretty cool, and a great example for others to follow — yes, I'm looking at you [Svelte Society Day 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rnG-OlzGSs)! 🙄\n\n> I love that I can fall behind on live stream of the conference, pause it, rewind and catch up as soon as I my days gets a bit open. Or I can just skip to whatever is happening live at the moment, and catch up with talks I missed sometime later. Try this with a live, in-person event.

For me personally, it was one of the most used features. Whenever I get overwhelmed with overdue tasks, usually on Fridays, I'd just hit \"Reschedule\". Todoist would just move all overdue tasks to the next week, minding their priority, existing daily task load, and so forth. Now that it's gone, my first instinct was to look for a different tool. Unfortunately, there's nothing there that I like enough to switch. And then I thought: wait a second, why can't I implement something like this myself? I mean, there's an [API available from Todoist](https://developer.todoist.com/sync/v8/), I've got my VS Code and some spare time on my hands... So here goes.\n\n> Honestly, I have no idea where it's going or whether something will come of it. I'm just going to document it for the time being and see how it goes.\n\n## Plan\n\nSo, Todoist has an API available to developers. There's a bunch of stuff I'll be using, but first and foremost — authentication.\n\nWith this out the way, let's move on to the sync endpoint. This endpoint provides us with whatever we're looking for, by resource type (literally, it's called `resource_type`).\n\n[https://developer.todoist.com/sync/v8/](https://developer.todoist.com/sync/v8/)\n\nI can request all tasks right here by specifying `resource_type=[\"items\"]`. Now we are getting somewhere. Here's what a sample item looks like.\n\n```json\n{\n      \"day_order\": 3,\n      \"assigned_by_uid\": null,\n      \"labels\": [\n        268788653,\n        2154348394\n      ],\n      \"sync_id\": null,\n      \"section_id\": null,\n      \"in_history\": 0,\n      \"child_order\": 11,\n      \"date_added\": \"2020-04-03T20:17:03Z\",\n      \"id\": 3794087901,\n      \"content\": \"Follow up [REDACTED]\",\n      \"checked\": 0,\n      \"added_by_uid\": 536129,\n      \"user_id\": 536129,\n      \"due\": {\n        \"date\": \"2020-07-05T20:00:00Z\",\n        \"timezone\": \"America/Los_Angeles\",\n        \"is_recurring\": true,\n        \"string\": \"every 1 months at 13:00\",\n        \"lang\": \"en\"\n      },\n      \"priority\": 4,\n      \"parent_id\": null,\n      \"is_deleted\": 0,\n      \"responsible_uid\": null,\n      \"project_id\": 2225607519,\n      \"date_completed\": null,\n      \"collapsed\": 0\n    },\n```\n\nWhat we need here is the item's priority, due date information, content, date added to figure out the item's age, whether it's deleted or not, and whether it's completed or not. This is the bare minimum, that would allow us to know if we should care about the item (not completed, not deleted), is the item overdue (is the due date in the past), how old the item is, what's its priority and what it's all about.\n\nJust for the sake of argument, here's a basic function to fetch some of this data:\n\n```typescript\n// I'm using Netlify Functions so we need to require node-fetch\nconst fetch = require(\"node-fetch\");\n\n// We don't need the `req` object here, but I was wondering what kind of stuff can I get if I trigger a webhook whenever a task is updated or created. How else could I trigger this function regularly?..\n\nexports.handler = async (req) => {\n  const itemsArray = [];\n  const data = await fetch(`https://api.todoist.com/sync/v8/sync`, {\n    method: \"POST\",\n    body: JSON.stringify({\"resource_types\": ['items']}),\n    headers: { \"Authorization\": \"Bearer ...\", \"Content-Type\": \"application/json\" }\n  })\n  const items = await data.json();\n  const list = await items.items // don't ask\n\n  const processItems = async (list) => {\n\t// initially, I wanted to just validate the items and return those I'm concerned about\n\tconst validItems =[];\n    const validItemsCheck = list.map(item => {\n      if(item.due && item.due.is_recurring === false && Date.now() > new Date(item.due.date).getTime() && ...){\n        const itemObject = {\n          item: {\n            id: item.id,\n            content: item.content,\n            due: item.due,\n            rescheduleScore: item.priority * 10 // magic coeffecient\n          },\n        }\n        validItems.push(itemObject)\n      }\n    })\n    return validItems;\n  }\n\n  return ({\"body\": JSON.stringify({\"overdue\": await processItems(list)}), \"statusCode\": 200})\n}\n```\n\nIt's not perfect, but it works. What I get in return is an array of items of interest with some of their metadata. Great start. Let's leave it at that for now.\n\n## What's next\n\nNow that I've got items I'm interested in, time to think about what am I going to do with them.\n\n### Analyze\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation for 10 upcoming days. Why 10? No reason. I need to figure out how many upcoming tasks of each priority I've got on each individual day. This will give me a map of the future. With this information, I'll be able to find out the exact number of free spots and how many tasks of different priorities I can reschedule for each day.\n\n### Process the tasks\n\nI need to check some stuff for my overdue items first.\n\n- **When was the task created?** This point may or may not be important later since it indicates how old the task is. A task I scheduled 2 years ago is probably something important, and I don't want it to slip through the cracks.\n- **When was the original due date?** Basically, how long has it been since the task expired? What day of the week was it? I'll try to see if I can reschedule this task to the same day of the week, if possible.\n- **What's the original priority?** If the task is important, it gets rescheduled first.\n- **Come up with a \"score\"**. In order to properly prioritize how I reschedule tasks, I will assign them a score. I tried to come up with some sensible way to do this:\n\n![Drawing](assets/blog/posts/todoist-smart-reschedule/8456d51f10b50af9a5d7a9c83e56a22ba7c00718-2000x1517.jpg)\n\nNot sure if any of this makes sense, but what I finally came up with is this:\n\n> Reversed Priority \\* (Task age in days + how many times has it been rescheduled)\n\nWe'll see if it works or not. For now, I'll stick to this.\n\nI'll post as soon as I get the above working to some extent.

What day of the week was it? I’ll try to see if I can reschedule this task to the same day of the week, if possible.</li>\n<li><strong>What’s the original priority?</strong> If the task is important, it gets rescheduled first.</li>\n<li><strong>Come up with a “score”</strong>.

Here're a few things I learned along the way.",["Date","2020-05-24T00:00:00.000Z"],"It's been just over 6 months since I joined [Auth0](https://auth0.com/) as their newest Developer Support Engineer. A bunch of my highbrow friends was very condescending. \"Oh, tech support. Good for you. With time, you'll become a real engineer\". I shrugged these comments off back then, but now I think it was cute of them to say things like this. As in \"Aww, honey. You have _no idea_ what you're talking about\" :)\n\nThe main reason for my chirpy attitude towards my then-new position has always been the fact that I enjoy troubleshooting and solving unexpected and obscure practical, real-life problems. I also really enjoy helping smarter people figure out stuff that I know more about. Not only does it expose me to a wide variety of systems and engineering approaches, but it also gives me a chance to connect with some fantastic people and soak in a ton of exclusive experiences. When you get to collaborate with some of the brightest engineers from the most forward-looking companies in the world on their critical cybersecurity infrastructure, it's something that is very easy for me to enjoy.\n\nI came up with some quick observations as well as misconceptions I want to share.\n\n## People who ask for help are not stupid\n\nA common misconception in the IT world is that people who reach out to their support are dumb. They can't figure things out on their own. They don't know what they are doing. They ask dumb questions. You get the idea. This can't be further from the truth.\n\nIn my case, identity and cybersecurity are extremely complex (to put it mildly), and the smartest people, smartest engineers reach out to us when they exhaust every other option available to them. There's nothing else they can do without some very specific expertise. In no way am I implying here that I now possess this expertise, but I certainly am in a better position to provide helpful advice. Sometimes, this advice is very specific to Auth0, but sometimes it's more specific to identity quirks (and by identity I mean authorization, authentication, user identity, role-based access control, OAuth, OIDC, and a multitude of other protocols, and so forth). It's so cool, I can't even.\n\n## Be clear who's side you are on\n\n![](assets/blog/posts/developer-support-observations/6d9b9853539df0982537138d4368881efca0c36e-480x270.gif)\n\nThis can be a bit controversial. I always make it clear that even though I work at Auth0, I'm here to represent the customer within Auth0. I first consider whatever the pain they encountered to be our fault. It's kind of an \"innocent until proven guilty\" approach: a customer got in a pickle and it's on us until or unless I can prove otherwise. I find this perspective to be quite helpful. You don't ask \"[have you tried turning it off and on again](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nn2FB1P_Mn8&feature=emb_title)\", you assume that you are the last resort for the customer. They tried everything and ended up nowhere. Is it because our [docs](https://auth0.com/docs) are bad? Is it because our product is difficult to use? Is it a bug on our end? An [outage](https://status.auth0.com/)? Until I can rule these out, it's on me to make sure the customer is aware of what I'm looking for first.\n\nWhen we implement a change that affects customers, I made it a point to get a clear message to them: I will raise hell internally to make sure that the customer's voice is heard loud and clear, and that their concerns will be taken seriously.\n\n## Screw-ups happen\n\n![Facepalm](assets/blog/posts/developer-support-observations/140b5fc3379513d9b6e3f76f2c77281eadbaefd2-602x482.jpg)\n\nIn the last 6 months, I screwed up more than once. I've sent a response meant for one customer to a different person with a different issue. I sent responses that were factually wrong. I misassigned a case in such a way that it went unnoticed for a week. I probably missed an SLA for a ticket resolution more than once. These things do happen and will happen, even in such a diverse, distributed, remote team of talented personalities as we have. They do happen less often with experience, yet there's no way to avoid this stuff entirely. Which brings us to my next point.\n\n## Sincere apologies go a long way\n\n![](assets/blog/posts/developer-support-observations/d342583e26063e1cb851f72e004accfd8d0cccd3-354x480.gif)\n\nThere are a few ways to apologize for your mistakes. One way is to say that you apologize for the poor experience. Another one is to express something along these lines:\n\n> Shit, I screwed up :( Like, I'm so very sorry. Jeez, what a disaster. This is not at all how I want you to experience Auth0. I'll make it up to you.\n\nObviously, the phrasing is different, but the sentiment remains clear. Whenever possible, I follow up with specifics: here's what happened, here's why I screwed up, these are the steps I'm taking to fix it, and here's why it will never happen again. Only once it didn't go too well: a customer got all snarky and passive-aggressive. Yet, I don't blame them; apologies are not a \"free get out of jail\" card. They are meant to convey, with 100% transparency, your fuckup exactly as it happened and what you're doing in response. That's it. If an occasional customer doesn't accept it, it's their right. At least, I'm doing all I can.\n\nIt's worth saying that in the absolutely vastest majority of cases, a sincere apology turned a disgruntled customer into a ~~raving fan~~ supporter.\n\n## You can't know everything\n\n![I know nothing](assets/blog/posts/developer-support-observations/cebbce2d501ca0be67dc91c8571ef87f67052d86-576x342.jpg)\n\nSometimes I feel like I'm drowning in a sea of information, knowledge, tricks, quirks, specifics, edge cases, and so on. One of my much senior colleagues demonstrated early on that there's no shame in not knowing something. Not because it's ok to be lazy and stop learning things, but because there's absolutely no way a single person can possibly know everything, even in their special area of expertise. If I don't know something, I just go and learn about it and move on. That's it.\n\n## You know the product better than most\n\n![I Know things](assets/blog/posts/developer-support-observations/27e3fe404ee76f485364a7c4689900e3cbf538c2-650x360.jpg)\n\nThis one is my favorite. As a developer support engineer, I get to touch pretty much every aspect of Auth0 products. I mean it: from sales to UI all the way to the core underlying tech and concepts. And I venture here and there on a daily basis. I won't pretend that I, in fact, do know our products better than most, not by a long shot. But also — not _yet_. Being exposed to all sorts of complex problems each element of Auth0 deals with and solves, not only helps me stay on my toes but also offers a great 30-thousand-feet view of everything we do as well as specific lines of code that are responsible for every aspect of the product.","src/content/blog/2020/05/24/developer-support-observations.md",[488,489,490,491,492,35],"assets/blog/posts/developer-support-observations/6d9b9853539df0982537138d4368881efca0c36e-480x270.gif","assets/blog/posts/developer-support-observations/140b5fc3379513d9b6e3f76f2c77281eadbaefd2-602x482.jpg","assets/blog/posts/developer-support-observations/d342583e26063e1cb851f72e004accfd8d0cccd3-354x480.gif","assets/blog/posts/developer-support-observations/cebbce2d501ca0be67dc91c8571ef87f67052d86-576x342.jpg","assets/blog/posts/developer-support-observations/27e3fe404ee76f485364a7c4689900e3cbf538c2-650x360.jpg","7a45a1d363ed6905",{html:495,metadata:496},"<p>It’s been just over 6 months since I joined <a href=\"https://auth0.com/\">Auth0</a> as their newest Developer Support Engineer.

In our last installment, we walked through the reason behind the project and my vague ideas about how to go about it.\n\n​Now, I've been tinkering with the project for a little bit and want to share some of my observations and where things stand at the moment.\n\nNot much has changed in how I think I will approach task rescheduling. However, I tweaked the parameters a bit. Let me recap:\n\n- Task age in days multiplied by -(Task priority) = Reschedule Score: a five-day-old task with a no priority (Task priority:4) gets a score of -20. A two-day-old task with top priority (1) will get a score of -2.\n- Tasks are divided into two groups: overdue and future. Tasks within each group are sorted descending by Reschedule Score: a task with the score of -2 will be ranked higher than a task with a score of -20. I bet there's a more elegant solution, but for now, this will do.\n- I removed the number of times the task had already been rescheduled before: it's evident to me now that this data point is not relevant: if a task has been rescheduled 20 times, it doesn't add anything to its importance (likely, the other way around). For now, I removed it from the equation.\n- Extra data: I decided to also fetch labels and projects from Todoist. I don't know yet how I'm going to use it exactly (other than showing what task belongs to what project/label). I also decided to fetch my overall Todoist stats (completed tasks, Karma, and so on), so that if I get to create a UI, I have all the data I want to showcase.\n\n### Next steps\n\nNext, I need to figure out how to go about, well, rescheduling tasks. As of this moment, the plan is this:\n\n- Figure out a good way to grade future days based on how many tasks they have and how important these tasks are. Maybe, priority multiplied by the number of tasks? I need to figure out a way to reverse priority so that a top priority task weighs more than a low priority. A day with 3 medium priority tasks and 2 top priority tasks will then have a day score of 12. I can set a maximum capacity for a given day of 15 points, so for such a day, I'll only be able to add one top priority task or 1 medium priority and 1 low priority, or 3 low priority tasks. Not sure it's smart enough, though 🤔\n- Figure out the actual rescheduling process. I mean, literally, how do I reschedule tasks using Todoist API? Do I need to specify the due time and date or is the date enough? Can I reschedule tasks relatively, as in \"reschedule this 5 days in future if task score fits day's capacity\"?\n- Do I need a backup? Should I store fetched tasks somewhere just in case?\n- Is there any existing \"science\" behind rescheduling stuff?\n\n## TypeScript\n\nI get distracted by shiny new objects really easily. Last night, I came across two fairly old talks on TypeScript:\n\n<YouTube id=\"AQOEZVG2WY0\" className=\"mx-auto min-w-full\" />\n\nThis talk is so old that arrow functions, classes, and string literals had already made their way into JavaScript! In this one, TypeScript 3.8 is announced. We are at 4.0 already!\n\n<YouTube id=\"jmPZztKIFf4\" className=\"mx-auto min-w-full\" />\n\nAs a result, I've completely rewritten my little serverless fetchTasks.js in TypeScript. It's a fantastic low-pressure introduction. Since TypeScript compiles to plain JavaScript, it remains a valid serverless lambda function, while I get to take full advantage of TypeScript: types, amazing IDE support, suggestions, and so on. And since I'm at the ground level of this project, it was really easy to figure out what types and interfaces I need and where I can get the most benefits moving forward.\n\nAnyway, stick around if you want to see me stumble around and make this thing happen after all!\n\n### Bonus\n\nHere's a sneak peek of what my current function returns. Future tasks are also included. All of this is also sorted by rescheduleScore and `importanceScore` for past due and future tasks respectively. As you can see, there's an interesting bug/feature: tasks that are due tomorrow (within a few hours from now) are considered overdue (which is a bug) but receive the highest rescheduleScore (which is a feature). I will fix this later by making sure that tasks with zero days left are not considered overdue 🤷‍♂️\n\n![](assets/blog/posts/todoist-smart-reschedule-typescript/793303ed8d5e0ba3f04b048ddcc3a8a2c9d9dda5-1290x1566.jpg)\n​","src/content/blog/2020/05/25/todoist-smart-reschedule-typescript.mdx",[35],"26841c89cce4deb1","2020/05/25/todoist-smart-reschedule-typescript.mdx","2020/06/12/resources",{id:589,data:591,body:596,filePath:597,assetImports:598,digest:599,rendered:600,legacyId:640},{title:592,image:593,category:74,description:594,publishDate:595},"Resources",{src:22,alt:23},"Sharing some helpful anti-racism resources.

For further accountability, I'm planning a week-long PCT hike from Stevens Pass to Snoqualmie Pass in early September, and that's a big reason why I'm trying to stick to this weekly training schedule. The hike I'll attempt is a 63-mile stretch of the Pacific Crest Trail with a total elevation gain of over 15,000 ft, so it makes sense to give my best shot at shorter and easier hikes at first, and gradually increase difficulty. Unsurprisingly, ever hike is much easier to hike than the one a week earlier: it's like my body really missed this kind of thing, and soaks it all in. Also, there's certainly a kind of low base effect: my fitness level is barely above zero, so it's fairly easy to make progress :)\n\nThis week I hit a trail that was marked as `moderate` in difficulty and `heavy trafficked`. It was one of the most enjoyable hikes I had so far, and while I wouldn't consider it \"easy\", it's probably on the easier side of \"moderate\".\n\nThe trail goes over [Sauk-Suiattle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sauk-Suiattle_Indian_Tribe_of_Washington) ancestral land — it's basically next door (right across the ridge) to the [Monte Cristo trail](/blog/monte-cristo-ghost-town-trail/) I hiked last week. It gently eases you into gradual ascent, offering some truly stunning views along the Elliot Creek. The creeks flow out of the Goat Lake, originally called Sweetleehachu by Sauk-Suiattle people. As soon as you get to the top of the waterfall, you've reached your destination.\n\n![Goat Lake Hike](assets/blog/posts/goat-lake-hike/385cd1d10b4b6c1a9aad6c8b8349f2dfadd3e283-1600x2134.jpg)\n\n![Goat Lake Hike](assets/blog/posts/goat-lake-hike/e93998bc88929345c84228530b278481be204816-1600x2134.jpg)\n\n![Goat Lake Hike](assets/blog/posts/goat-lake-hike/8b17b53fca6ef950ccacd57cd25014ef33d898fc-1600x1200.jpg)\n\n![Goat Lake Hike](assets/blog/posts/goat-lake-hike/e2d3f320d085118c70716a826a8aa1f1553c8f55-1600x1200.jpg)\n\n![Goat Lake Hike](assets/blog/posts/goat-lake-hike/ae7dfeaba7277a2e0b576cd32f74c9a0bdf83b3e-1600x2134.jpg)\n\nThere's a section of the trail where you can choose your own adventure: hike like a normal person on a bunch of switchbacks but miss the bottom of the waterfall, or go straight to the bottom of the waterfall.\n\n![~250 ft waterfall is fantastically scenic, loud and refreshing](assets/blog/posts/goat-lake-hike/5a7a9fb1121a08419030e28dd330a655e9d7f60a-2000x920.jpg)\n\nIf you choose to check out the falls, you'll have to then climb (and I mean _climb_) about 150 feet, pretty much vertically, over about 130 yards of distance.

It's quiet, serene, clear, and ice-cold. Although the trail is marked as heavily trafficked, I only met, like, 5 other parties along the trail, one other group at the lake, and when the left, I got the whole lake to myself.\n\nMy lunch spot this time was right on the lakeshore, but I was not hungry enough to cook.

For further accountability, I’m planning a week-long PCT hike from Stevens Pass to Snoqualmie Pass in early September, and that’s a big reason why I’m trying to stick to this weekly training schedule. The hike I’ll attempt is a 63-mile stretch of the Pacific Crest Trail with a total elevation gain of over 15,000 ft, so it makes sense to give my best shot at shorter and easier hikes at first, and gradually increase difficulty. Unsurprisingly, ever hike is much easier to hike than the one a week earlier: it’s like my body really missed this kind of thing, and soaks it all in. Also, there’s certainly a kind of low base effect: my fitness level is barely above zero, so it’s fairly easy to make progress :)</p>\n<p>This week I hit a trail that was marked as <code>moderate</code> in difficulty and <code>heavy trafficked</code>. It was one of the most enjoyable hikes I had so far, and while I wouldn’t consider it “easy”, it’s probably on the easier side of “moderate”.</p>\n<p>The trail goes over <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sauk-Suiattle_Indian_Tribe_of_Washington\">Sauk-Suiattle</a> ancestral land — it’s basically next door (right across the ridge) to the <a href=\"/blog/monte-cristo-ghost-town-trail/\">Monte Cristo trail</a> I hiked last week.

I just returned from my 2-night hike to White Pass, and jeesh was it rough! Now I'm thinking it would be madness to attempt the [Stevens Pass to Snoqualmie Pass](https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/hikes/pacific-crest-trail-section-j-snoqualmie-pass-to-stevens-pass-east), _Section J,_ of the PCT this year. Hell, I'm not even sure I can do my _Plan B_, the [Loowit Trail](https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/hikes/loowit) anymore! But hey, let me decompress a little, think, plan some more, and see how it goes.\n\n> 60,000+ steps, 600 floors.\n\nI also lost 8 lbs in 2 days.\n\nThe plan was simple: arrive at Sloan Creek campground on Thursday, camp for the night. On Friday hike to White Pass. On Saturday hike back. Simple enough.\n\nAs always, I had a plan B: hike to Mackinaw shelter, camp there, and hike back on Saturday. This would be a chill and relaxed 12 miles over two days.\n\n[North Fork Sauk River — Washington Trails Association](https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/hikes/north-fork-sauk-river)\n\n## Adventure\n\nThis was my first `Hard` trail, and I didn't expect it to be any less than a painful struggle with a payoff in a form of a spectacular overview of Washington's Cascade peaks and chill evenings in my tent.\n\n> Of course, nothing went according to plan.\n\nI arrived at the parking lot later than planned. I knew that Mountain Loop highway was pretty bad, and indeed 16 miles from Darrington down to Forest Service road 49 (it's actually marked as NF-49, National Forest road) and then about 7 miles to the trailhead took me over an hour. The road is rough but passable, even for someone in a Civic Coupe.\n\nAnyway, Thursday night was pretty empty at the campground, and I had no issue setting up my tent in a secluded area not too far from the river.\n\nIt was raining a little bit, and setting up a new tent for the first time _in the wild_ was not too fun. Moreover, apparently, I didn't bring enough ground stakes. As a result, I didn't get proper ventilation inside the tent overnight and I woke up all damp and wet: condensation is a bitch.\n\n![Packed and ready to go!](assets/blog/posts/white-pass-hike/3d824b61644739be2c2c028ab58a050a1c5d771c-1600x1200.jpg)\n\nAfter breakfast, I hit the trail towards Mackinaw Shelter, a known landmark at the end of the North Fork Saul trail right before it climbs uphill to White Pass. Unfortunately, the shelter collapsed a few years ago. Now it's just a bunch of rubble :(\n\n![Mackinaw Shelter 2020](assets/blog/posts/white-pass-hike/9f715571de8edb11f947583398324613950e4bb5-2000x1500.jpg)\n\nStill, there's a nice campground area around with river access, and it's perfectly suited for a nice and chill overnight or a relaxing lunch break.\n\nThe trail all the way to the shelter goes relatively flat along the North Fork Sauk river through [Sauk-Suiattle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sauk-Suiattle_Indian_Tribe_of_Washington) native land. It's mostly shaded and crosses a bunch of tiny streams. There's only one place on the trail that requires some scrambling due to a downed tree.\n\n![Downed Tree](assets/blog/posts/white-pass-hike/e7071e28e2f9c0c60b571f80240a403f82c0d5c3-2000x2667.jpg)\n\nQuiet, chill stroll among the old-growth forest. A lot of moss, green, shade, a lot of little critters running around. Mosquitos are a concern.\n\n![Trail](assets/blog/posts/white-pass-hike/7c514e3cb9dd85e881591cd6b664b2f51d17f14c-2000x1500.jpg)\n\n![All trails lead to PCT!](assets/blog/posts/white-pass-hike/457b6ea18db05e63b5985fadf435efc702e50cc7-2000x1500.jpg)\n\nAnyway, after a quick lunch at Mackinaw Shelter campground, I made an executive decision to proceed all the way to White Pass, 3,000 ft ascent over ~3 miles. It was around 4 pm and I figured I'd be there before dark. Boy, was I wrong.\n\nThe trail starts at around 3,000 ft of elevation, and for the next 3 miles, it goes straight up. Yes, there are switchbacks, but it's for real, a full-on ascent non-stop. There are no flat segments. The trail itself is much different from a soft forest trail. It's very rocky in places, there are a few spots where the trail becomes a stream for a few yards; on my way back, I slipped and fell flat on my butt in one of these streams 😂\n\n![Trail](assets/blog/posts/white-pass-hike/0fdfc12d003c4dacda55909567bea1dc7981ee27-2400x3200.jpg)\n\nI was moving very slowly. I was taking short breaks every few hundred yards, long breaks every 500 ft of elevation gain. Yes, my pace was at about 2 hours/mile, but I'm absolutely convinced that this approach is the only reason I was able to make it all the way to the top. But you know what they say: [HYOH](https://www.pcta.org/journalist/post/hike-your-own-hike-what-does-it-mean/).\n\nThe weather was fairly clear, but the ascent was so strenuous that I took only a few pictures. \"After I get to the top, tomorrow, I'll make all the pictures in the world, from a better position!\", I thought.\n\n![Jackson Mountain (6,721 ft)](assets/blog/posts/white-pass-hike/6d0f05dd069e46bc2b691754d09623ea8b245440-2000x1500.jpg)\n\nI ended up traveling the last mile and a half in complete darkness. My headlamp died on me, it started drizzling, and a thick fog settled around. So here I am, in the dark, on a narrow trail on a mountainside with about 3000-feet drop on the right and a vertical hill on the left; by this time, I ran out of water and illuminated my way with my iPhone flashlight. After a Fucking Fuck creek (yes, I named a dried out creek, sue me!), I finally came across a stream and refilled my water bottle. I successfully made it to the intersection of my trail with the PCT, and from there it was a fairly easy hike to the White Pass camp area.\n\nWhen my iPhone died, I found another, dimmer flashlight and used it to navigate the camp area. In the fog, at night, and through the drizzle, it was not easy. So much so that as soon as I saw a lit tent in the distance, I started to look for any flat surface to pitch my tent. While stumbling around a meadow, I startled a bunch of deer, who didn't expect me there at that hour, I guess.\n\nNow, I'm in some meadow, exhausted, wet, aching all over, my backup flashlight is about to die, and I need to pitch a tent that is still very new to me. It took me about 20 minutes to complete this task, and by the time I got inside and set my sleeping system, it was close to midnight. I sent a check-in message to the family and dropped asleep.\n\n![Morning view from my tent at White Mountain](assets/blog/posts/white-pass-hike/4a24bbb209d69385fb17482d086ca100ed9b3c54-2000x2667.jpg)\n\nYeah, the morning was refreshing. It was cloudy and foggy, and you couldn't see anything anywhere. Which is a pity; one of the points of hiking this high and seeing all the peaks and volcanoes... Oh, well.\n\nHere's a picture of gorgeous 10,500-feet Glacier Peak, known in the Sauk-Suiattle dialect of the [Lushootseed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lushootseed) language as \"Tda-ko-buh-ba\" or \"Takobia\". It is the most isolated stratovolcano in the Cascade Range. Beautiful, isn't it? It's the 4th highest point in Washington after Tahoma, Pahto, and Kulshan (Rainier, Adams, and Baker)\n\n![Truth be told, from this point I'd only see White mountain. But a short hike up this mountain, an actual Glacier Peak would appear.](assets/blog/posts/white-pass-hike/9bf8bb9fe36832a69cf3ba000bde42ac41fc0329-2000x1500.jpg)\n\nAfter breakfast, I refilled all my water containers and headed back to the parking lot. White Pass is a pretty busy area at this time of year with a lot of hikers and climbers arriving on Saturday morning. By this time I looked dirty, wet, and tired enough for incoming hikers to ask me where the nearest water source is, how to get to the camp or this other trail, where toilets are and so on. On my long and fairly slow descent, I met a lot of people (mostly climbers) and we had a few brief conversations. A bunch of people who overtook me were in my camp of disappointed by the weather.\n\n![I looked forward to this intersection on my way up and almost missed it 🤦‍♂️](assets/blog/posts/white-pass-hike/23b4d3dfd46f0e3a5a6ee9963e04b71c3ca5f35b-1600x1200.jpg)\n\nA quick peek-a-boo of Mt.

I was looking for a creek crossing first, never crossed this creek, and when I finally got to it, well, Mackinaw Shelter was like 2 miles back.\n\nThe creek I was looking for was Red Creek; it has a nice camping area with a ton of spacious dispersed tent spots, firepits and such. But for me, it was all about the creek at that point. I just laid on my back beside roaring water before refilling my water bottle and heading straight back to the parking lot.\n\n![Red Creek](assets/blog/posts/white-pass-hike/fa7764d5552785d8ad86cdd9283769e2806ea928-2000x1500.jpg)\n\nAbout a mile away from the trailhead, another peek-a-boo happened, that I didn't really expect. It was just after sunset, and it was a nice (if a bit ironic) closure to my peak-watching hike.\n\n![Sloan Peak (7,835 ft)](assets/blog/posts/white-pass-hike/49be992c1149fd0ed061bb19bb5e828e71a94360-2000x1500.jpg)\n\n## Notes\n\nI forgot my hat and had to fashion headgear out of a face mask (?)\n\n![Me](assets/blog/posts/white-pass-hike/07ecd045c5a69cb9100b22cb55f39e3f4dba3c15-1600x2130.jpg)\n\nLooks like, as always, I carried 70% more food than needed. I literally only had 2 breakfasts and 2 snacks. I brought 4 full meals and most snacks back.\n\nAfter my hectic night arrival at White Pass, my pack got disorganized beyond repair. By morning, I was unable to organize it back to the proper state. Need to learn this skill.\n\nMy hiking shoes are .5 size too small. I mean, they are half a size larger than I'd normally wear, but it's still too small. Will try to exchange them for a bigger pair at REI 🤞\n\nI ran out of bug spray.

I just returned from my 2-night hike to White Pass, and jeesh was it rough!

But hey, let me decompress a little, think, plan some more, and see how it goes.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>60,000+ steps, 600 floors.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I also lost 8 lbs in 2 days.</p>\n<p>The plan was simple: arrive at Sloan Creek campground on Thursday, camp for the night. On Friday hike to White Pass. On Saturday hike back. Simple enough.</p>\n<p>As always, I had a plan B: hike to Mackinaw shelter, camp there, and hike back on Saturday. This would be a chill and relaxed 12 miles over two days.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/hikes/north-fork-sauk-river\">North Fork Sauk River — Washington Trails Association</a></p>\n<h2 id=\"adventure\">Adventure</h2>\n<p>This was my first <code>Hard</code> trail, and I didn’t expect it to be any less than a painful struggle with a payoff in a form of a spectacular overview of Washington’s Cascade peaks and chill evenings in my tent.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Of course, nothing went according to plan.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I arrived at the parking lot later than planned. I knew that Mountain Loop highway was pretty bad, and indeed 16 miles from Darrington down to Forest Service road 49 (it’s actually marked as NF-49, National Forest road) and then about 7 miles to the trailhead took me over an hour. The road is rough but passable, even for someone in a Civic Coupe.</p>\n<p>Anyway, Thursday night was pretty empty at the campground, and I had no issue setting up my tent in a secluded area not too far from the river.</p>\n<p>It was raining a little bit, and setting up a new tent for the first time <em>in the wild</em> was not too fun. Moreover, apparently, I didn’t bring enough ground stakes. As a result, I didn’t get proper ventilation inside the tent overnight and I woke up all damp and wet: condensation is a bitch.</p>\n<p><img __ASTRO_IMAGE_=\"{&#x22;src&#x22;:&#x22;assets/blog/posts/white-pass-hike/3d824b61644739be2c2c028ab58a050a1c5d771c-1600x1200.jpg&#x22;,&#x22;alt&#x22;:&#x22;Packed and ready to go!&#x22;,&#x22;index&#x22;:0}\"></p>\n<p>After breakfast, I hit the trail towards Mackinaw Shelter, a known landmark at the end of the North Fork Saul trail right before it climbs uphill to White Pass.

It was around 4 pm and I figured I’d be there before dark. Boy, was I wrong.</p>\n<p>The trail starts at around 3,000 ft of elevation, and for the next 3 miles, it goes straight up. Yes, there are switchbacks, but it’s for real, a full-on ascent non-stop. There are no flat segments. The trail itself is much different from a soft forest trail. It’s very rocky in places, there are a few spots where the trail becomes a stream for a few yards; on my way back, I slipped and fell flat on my butt in one of these streams 😂</p>\n<p><img __ASTRO_IMAGE_=\"{&#x22;src&#x22;:&#x22;assets/blog/posts/white-pass-hike/0fdfc12d003c4dacda55909567bea1dc7981ee27-2400x3200.jpg&#x22;,&#x22;alt&#x22;:&#x22;Trail&#x22;,&#x22;index&#x22;:0}\"></p>\n<p>I was moving very slowly. I was taking short breaks every few hundred yards, long breaks every 500 ft of elevation gain. Yes, my pace was at about 2 hours/mile, but I’m absolutely convinced that this approach is the only reason I was able to make it all the way to the top. But you know what they say: <a href=\"https://www.pcta.org/journalist/post/hike-your-own-hike-what-does-it-mean/\">HYOH</a>.</p>\n<p>The weather was fairly clear, but the ascent was so strenuous that I took only a few pictures. “After I get to the top, tomorrow, I’ll make all the pictures in the world, from a better position!”, I thought.</p>\n<p><img __ASTRO_IMAGE_=\"{&#x22;src&#x22;:&#x22;assets/blog/posts/white-pass-hike/6d0f05dd069e46bc2b691754d09623ea8b245440-2000x1500.jpg&#x22;,&#x22;alt&#x22;:&#x22;Jackson Mountain (6,721 ft)&#x22;,&#x22;index&#x22;:0}\"></p>\n<p>I ended up traveling the last mile and a half in complete darkness. My headlamp died on me, it started drizzling, and a thick fog settled around. So here I am, in the dark, on a narrow trail on a mountainside with about 3000-feet drop on the right and a vertical hill on the left; by this time, I ran out of water and illuminated my way with my iPhone flashlight. After a Fucking Fuck creek (yes, I named a dried out creek, sue me!), I finally came across a stream and refilled my water bottle. I successfully made it to the intersection of my trail with the PCT, and from there it was a fairly easy hike to the White Pass camp area.</p>\n<p>When my iPhone died, I found another, dimmer flashlight and used it to navigate the camp area. In the fog, at night, and through the drizzle, it was not easy. So much so that as soon as I saw a lit tent in the distance, I started to look for any flat surface to pitch my tent. While stumbling around a meadow, I startled a bunch of deer, who didn’t expect me there at that hour, I guess.</p>\n<p>Now, I’m in some meadow, exhausted, wet, aching all over, my backup flashlight is about to die, and I need to pitch a tent that is still very new to me. It took me about 20 minutes to complete this task, and by the time I got inside and set my sleeping system, it was close to midnight. I sent a check-in message to the family and dropped asleep.</p>\n<p><img __ASTRO_IMAGE_=\"{&#x22;src&#x22;:&#x22;assets/blog/posts/white-pass-hike/4a24bbb209d69385fb17482d086ca100ed9b3c54-2000x2667.jpg&#x22;,&#x22;alt&#x22;:&#x22;Morning view from my tent at White Mountain&#x22;,&#x22;index&#x22;:0}\"></p>\n<p>Yeah, the morning was refreshing. It was cloudy and foggy, and you couldn’t see anything anywhere. Which is a pity; one of the points of hiking this high and seeing all the peaks and volcanoes… Oh, well.</p>\n<p>Here’s a picture of gorgeous 10,500-feet Glacier Peak, known in the Sauk-Suiattle dialect of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lushootseed\">Lushootseed</a> language as “Tda-ko-buh-ba” or “Takobia”. It is the most isolated stratovolcano in the Cascade Range. Beautiful, isn’t it? It’s the 4th highest point in Washington after Tahoma, Pahto, and Kulshan (Rainier, Adams, and Baker)</p>\n<p><img __ASTRO_IMAGE_=\"{&#x22;src&#x22;:&#x22;assets/blog/posts/white-pass-hike/9bf8bb9fe36832a69cf3ba000bde42ac41fc0329-2000x1500.jpg&#x22;,&#x22;alt&#x22;:&#x22;Truth be told, from this point I&#x27;d only see White mountain.

White Pass is a pretty busy area at this time of year with a lot of hikers and climbers arriving on Saturday morning. By this time I looked dirty, wet, and tired enough for incoming hikers to ask me where the nearest water source is, how to get to the camp or this other trail, where toilets are and so on. On my long and fairly slow descent, I met a lot of people (mostly climbers) and we had a few brief conversations. A bunch of people who overtook me were in my camp of disappointed by the weather.</p>\n<p><img __ASTRO_IMAGE_=\"{&#x22;src&#x22;:&#x22;assets/blog/posts/white-pass-hike/23b4d3dfd46f0e3a5a6ee9963e04b71c3ca5f35b-1600x1200.jpg&#x22;,&#x22;alt&#x22;:&#x22;I looked forward to this intersection on my way up and almost missed it 🤦‍♂️&#x22;,&#x22;index&#x22;:0}\"></p>\n<p>A quick peek-a-boo of Mt.

I just laid on my back beside roaring water before refilling my water bottle and heading straight back to the parking lot.</p>\n<p><img __ASTRO_IMAGE_=\"{&#x22;src&#x22;:&#x22;assets/blog/posts/white-pass-hike/fa7764d5552785d8ad86cdd9283769e2806ea928-2000x1500.jpg&#x22;,&#x22;alt&#x22;:&#x22;Red Creek&#x22;,&#x22;index&#x22;:0}\"></p>\n<p>About a mile away from the trailhead, another peek-a-boo happened, that I didn’t really expect.

I've got two days off (Thursday and Friday) and decided it's a great opportunity to try and go on a 3-night & 23-mile backpacking trip near Glacier Peak. Let me just say that it ended up being a 12-mile 2-night trip... 20 miles away from the trail I've initially planned to hike. It's a funny story, actually.\n\nLet me back up a little. I plan my hikes in advance, and I put quite a bit of work into this planning. I want to know what to expect, what to prepare for, what to look forward to. Before I arrive at the trailhead, I usually have a map, a backup map, a plan, a route, planned campsites, _Plan B_ campsites, water sources, sketchy river crossings, and more. I also try to tailor the gear and supplies I take with me to the specifics of the trail I'm about to spend a few days on.\n\nThis trip was no exception. I planned to hike a 23-mile loop, starting at North Fork Skykomish river trailhead and going counter-clockwise via Cady Ridge towards Dishpan Gap and back along the river. It supposed to take me 3 full days (allowing for unexpected) and included climbing Benchmark Mountain and hiking about 6 miles of the Pacific Crest Trail.\n\nI planned to arrive at the trailhead before dark on Wednesday; it sounded like a sure thing. The road to the trailhead was a fairly straight line from Index, WA which is fairly close to my house. With offline maps in hand, I packed my pack, got into my car, and took off.\n\nNow. When you turn a corner and see an old mossy sign saying that the road is closed ahead, don't disregard it. Maybe the sign is there for a reason, and Google Maps, Apple Maps, and some other maps just don't know better. This was my first mistake — trusting technologies instead of a road sign. Anywho, about 13 miles from the trailhead I stopped at a road barricade saying \"Road Closed\". I was in such a shock that I didn't even take a photo, but here's the exact spot of the barricade.\n\n![© Rod Crowford](assets/blog/posts/lake-valhalla-hike/d68e1865335a2443b5b13953ec28bcab1cb98228-500x375.jpg)\n\nOr here:\n\n![© Neil Hodges](assets/blog/posts/lake-valhalla-hike/1a2c3b732dd1072594610deed01cece77ce42fd6-1600x1200.jpg)\n\nAnyway, suffice to say, the \"Road Closed\" sing was ~~ironic~~ redundant. Apparently, this section of the road washed away in 2006 and is now North Fork Skykomish river 🤷‍♂️\n\nPicture this: 30 minutes before sunset, you're in the middle of nowhere. Your GPS tells you to take the riverbed for another 30 minutes, and you have no _Plan B_ for this type of situation. What to do? Go home, admit defeat, regroup, and try again tomorrow? But then a 3-night hike would turn into a 2-night hike, and also it's just lame. Try to find a different road? Perhaps, but who knows how long it would take, and also what if there is no other road?!\n\nWell, regroup and adapt is basically my life motto. So I regrouped. And adapted. What other trails I know in the vicinity that would guarantee at least 3 days' worth of backpacking, have campsites and I know something about the trail itself? Bingo! There's a spot where PCT crosses Highway 2 just 30 minutes east of Index. I know PCT. I know there are campsites, water sources, and attractions, and boy does PCT guarantee 3 days' worth of hiking!.. Onward!\n\nAt sunset, I arrived at Stevens Pass. I decided to take the northbound trail; I parked my car, geared up, and stepped on the trail. It's going to be an adventure!\n\n![Pacific Crest Trail](assets/blog/posts/lake-valhalla-hike/ea03a8182b00f9dc6a59a84342e52422b8a9ff6b-1600x1200.jpg)\n\nAbout half a mile in, I realized that I forgot my hiking poles in the trunk. It wouldn't be a problem if my tent didn't require these poles. Alas, I went all the way back to the parking lot, mumbling quite elaborate curses under my breath. By the time I stepped on the trail _again_, it was dark. I already made the decision to attempt my first actual night hike (disregard forced night hike at White Pass!), so I strapped on my headlamp, turned it on, and went ahead.\n\n> This section of the trail goes through ancestral land of Skokomish Nation. This particular section is on the very outskirts of their lands since the tribe historically lives along the Skykomish river, still this is [Skokomish Indian Tribe](http://www.skokomish.org/) land.\n\nThe new plan was to reach Valhalla Lake. Ironically, it's one of the super-popular hiking destinations in the area — I try really hard to avoid popular hikes at all costs. But remember? Regroup and adapt! So the new plan was to attempt this 6+ mile hike (~1,800 feet of elevation gain) and set up camp at the lake. The next day, hike along the PCT as far as I can, and the day after, push to get back in one go. Plan B was to hike right now as far as I can or until I find a suitable place to pitch up my tent. This Plan B very soon turned into Plan A. Hiking at night in the relative wilderness on an unfamiliar trail is very exciting, but since my ultimate goal was to get back home in one piece, I decided that I'll stop as soon as I find a good place for a tent.\n\n> Crossing streams in the dark with only a headlamp illuminating the way is such a surreal experience! The shimmering water, sparkling rocks, and complete darkness. A thrill!\n\nAbout 3 miles in, I found a spot by a creek and decided to spend the night there. Since setting up my tent in the dark is now my second nature, it only took me about 10 minutes to get all set for the night.\n\nI didn't get much sleep. Not sure if it was the excitement of an adventure, anxiety about ruined plans, or something else entirely, but I woke up groggy and sore. I refilled my water, had breakfast, and spent probably an hour just relaxing, enjoying nature, and not doing jack squat. At this point, I made an executive decision to hike to lake Valhalla and reassess my options. Should I hike further? Or should I spend the night at the lake and go back? 🤔\n\nThe hike was beautiful, as expected. Pretty easy, gentle incline, lots of shade and places to pause and breath.\n\n![PCT](assets/blog/posts/lake-valhalla-hike/6b3b041ff6e283dc89be5a67f54c5d7236be9b41-1600x2134.jpg)\n\nThe views are stunning, and I got really lucky considering a bunch of rain in the forecast.\n\n![PCT](assets/blog/posts/lake-valhalla-hike/502053512a4ed05acd0376c97cd3e18cb0abc4a9-2000x1224.jpg)\n\nAround 2 in the afternoon, I arrived at Lake Valhalla. It's a regular lake. Just a lake. Like, just like any other lake. It's pretty, but it's not a gem or something.\n\n![Lake Valhalla](assets/blog/posts/lake-valhalla-hike/ba3140deb787527b06743d7335c7a27184c2cc93-1600x1200.jpg)\n\nWhatever. By the time I got there, it was clear that my sleepless night left me no choice but to set up camp and take a nap. Which I did.\n\n![Lake Valhalla](assets/blog/posts/lake-valhalla-hike/9d6e7612347f5b595f2b9248cd7b51575ec2fca6-2000x2667.jpg)\n\nI napped for a few hours with bees buzzing in the background and hungry mosquitoes staring at me through the net side of my tent. When I woke up, I decided that I'm not going anywhere today. I'll stay here, make dinner, get some good night's sleep and see how it goes. Do I hike further? Do I turn back? I'll think about it tomorrow.\n\n![Lake Valhalla](assets/blog/posts/lake-valhalla-hike/f8126d4d58f577a682160bf8ea22314f89cb0dd1-1600x2134.jpg)\n\nWhen tomorrow came, I was conflicted about my immediate future. On one hand, I came here to hike, and turning back is admitting defeat. On the other hand, I have nowhere to hike, really; I don't know if there are significant features further down the trail, I don't have a mile count in place to make sure I can return in time. I already wasted almost a day at the lake napping. Well, I guess it only makes sense to cut this short, return to the trailhead, and go back home. Breakfast, water refill, packing — and off I go.\n\n![This is a marmot. His name is Hooch. ](assets/blog/posts/lake-valhalla-hike/b9db6717fe9834b1889645b3f77a50dcee4dd07f-1600x1600.jpg)\n\nIt was raining half of my way back, and I was too lazy to put on my raincoat. What's the point? I'll be in my car in, like, an hour, and will dry out within minutes. Also, who doesn't love rain? What's wrong with you?! :)\n\nOn my way back home, I thought I'd get some closure and find the road to my originally planned trailhead. Before doing so, I stopped for a quick minute in a tiny town of Skykomish (~200 residents) and went to their world-famous [Great Northern & Cascade Railway](https://www.greatnortherncascaderailway.com/) museum. It's tiny but welcoming and cute, and if you ask nicely, they'll show you their collection of telegraph keys and tell a story about 20,000 telegraph operators who were serving the road in the past and refused to teach their trade to anyone outside of their immediate families.\n\n![Great Northern & Cascade Railway museum](assets/blog/posts/lake-valhalla-hike/9dbcbe95976bc83c908b712e08385801aebe5e44-2000x1500.jpg)\n\n![Skykomish River](assets/blog/posts/lake-valhalla-hike/25e703e8f2961e8a3a60767af7d920c5249a5b4a-2000x1500.jpg)\n\nAnd after some more research, I figured out the road to the trailhead I was originally planning to go to. It took me over an hour to cover something around 20 miles from Skykomish to the trailhead, but I did it.\n\n![Me](assets/blog/posts/lake-valhalla-hike/e420bf7ab21ab86d5c4ad140baffb54b3155f03d-1600x1202.jpg)\n\n![I should've been riiiight there at the top](assets/blog/posts/lake-valhalla-hike/a40f512a3006cfeefaeabae15d70e5004b879a91-2000x2667.jpg)\n\nAt the end of the day, I got to hike for a bit, spend two lazy days in nature, spooked a marmot, and found a way to the trailhead. Good times!\n\nNext week is my vacation week, and I'm doing the [Loowit trail](https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/hikes/loowit) — a 33-mile loop around Mt. St. Helens.\n\nP.S.

I’ve got two days off (Thursday and Friday) and decided it’s a great opportunity to try and go on a 3-night &#x26; 23-mile backpacking trip near Glacier Peak. Let me just say that it ended up being a 12-mile 2-night trip… 20 miles away from the trail I’ve initially planned to hike. It’s a funny story, actually.</p>\n<p>Let me back up a little. I plan my hikes in advance, and I put quite a bit of work into this planning. I want to know what to expect, what to prepare for, what to look forward to. Before I arrive at the trailhead, I usually have a map, a backup map, a plan, a route, planned campsites, <em>Plan B</em> campsites, water sources, sketchy river crossings, and more. I also try to tailor the gear and supplies I take with me to the specifics of the trail I’m about to spend a few days on.</p>\n<p>This trip was no exception. I planned to hike a 23-mile loop, starting at North Fork Skykomish river trailhead and going counter-clockwise via Cady Ridge towards Dishpan Gap and back along the river. It supposed to take me 3 full days (allowing for unexpected) and included climbing Benchmark Mountain and hiking about 6 miles of the Pacific Crest Trail.</p>\n<p>I planned to arrive at the trailhead before dark on Wednesday; it sounded like a sure thing. The road to the trailhead was a fairly straight line from Index, WA which is fairly close to my house. With offline maps in hand, I packed my pack, got into my car, and took off.</p>\n<p>Now. When you turn a corner and see an old mossy sign saying that the road is closed ahead, don’t disregard it. Maybe the sign is there for a reason, and Google Maps, Apple Maps, and some other maps just don’t know better. This was my first mistake — trusting technologies instead of a road sign. Anywho, about 13 miles from the trailhead I stopped at a road barricade saying “Road Closed”. I was in such a shock that I didn’t even take a photo, but here’s the exact spot of the barricade.</p>\n<p><img __ASTRO_IMAGE_=\"{&#x22;src&#x22;:&#x22;assets/blog/posts/lake-valhalla-hike/d68e1865335a2443b5b13953ec28bcab1cb98228-500x375.jpg&#x22;,&#x22;alt&#x22;:&#x22;© Rod Crowford&#x22;,&#x22;index&#x22;:0}\"></p>\n<p>Or here:</p>\n<p><img __ASTRO_IMAGE_=\"{&#x22;src&#x22;:&#x22;assets/blog/posts/lake-valhalla-hike/1a2c3b732dd1072594610deed01cece77ce42fd6-1600x1200.jpg&#x22;,&#x22;alt&#x22;:&#x22;© Neil Hodges&#x22;,&#x22;index&#x22;:0}\"></p>\n<p>Anyway, suffice to say, the “Road Closed” sing was <del>ironic</del> redundant. Apparently, this section of the road washed away in 2006 and is now North Fork Skykomish river 🤷‍♂️</p>\n<p>Picture this: 30 minutes before sunset, you’re in the middle of nowhere. Your GPS tells you to take the riverbed for another 30 minutes, and you have no <em>Plan B</em> for this type of situation. What to do? Go home, admit defeat, regroup, and try again tomorrow? But then a 3-night hike would turn into a 2-night hike, and also it’s just lame. Try to find a different road? Perhaps, but who knows how long it would take, and also what if there is no other road?!</p>\n<p>Well, regroup and adapt is basically my life motto. So I regrouped. And adapted. What other trails I know in the vicinity that would guarantee at least 3 days’ worth of backpacking, have campsites and I know something about the trail itself? Bingo! There’s a spot where PCT crosses Highway 2 just 30 minutes east of Index. I know PCT. I know there are campsites, water sources, and attractions, and boy does PCT guarantee 3 days’ worth of hiking!.. Onward!</p>\n<p>At sunset, I arrived at Stevens Pass. I decided to take the northbound trail; I parked my car, geared up, and stepped on the trail. It’s going to be an adventure!</p>\n<p><img __ASTRO_IMAGE_=\"{&#x22;src&#x22;:&#x22;assets/blog/posts/lake-valhalla-hike/ea03a8182b00f9dc6a59a84342e52422b8a9ff6b-1600x1200.jpg&#x22;,&#x22;alt&#x22;:&#x22;Pacific Crest Trail&#x22;,&#x22;index&#x22;:0}\"></p>\n<p>About half a mile in, I realized that I forgot my hiking poles in the trunk. It wouldn’t be a problem if my tent didn’t require these poles. Alas, I went all the way back to the parking lot, mumbling quite elaborate curses under my breath. By the time I stepped on the trail <em>again</em>, it was dark. I already made the decision to attempt my first actual night hike (disregard forced night hike at White Pass!), so I strapped on my headlamp, turned it on, and went ahead.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>This section of the trail goes through ancestral land of Skokomish Nation. This particular section is on the very outskirts of their lands since the tribe historically lives along the Skykomish river, still this is <a href=\"http://www.skokomish.org/\">Skokomish Indian Tribe</a> land.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The new plan was to reach Valhalla Lake. Ironically, it’s one of the super-popular hiking destinations in the area — I try really hard to avoid popular hikes at all costs. But remember? Regroup and adapt! So the new plan was to attempt this 6+ mile hike (~1,800 feet of elevation gain) and set up camp at the lake. The next day, hike along the PCT as far as I can, and the day after, push to get back in one go. Plan B was to hike right now as far as I can or until I find a suitable place to pitch up my tent. This Plan B very soon turned into Plan A. Hiking at night in the relative wilderness on an unfamiliar trail is very exciting, but since my ultimate goal was to get back home in one piece, I decided that I’ll stop as soon as I find a good place for a tent.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Crossing streams in the dark with only a headlamp illuminating the way is such a surreal experience! The shimmering water, sparkling rocks, and complete darkness. A thrill!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>About 3 miles in, I found a spot by a creek and decided to spend the night there. Since setting up my tent in the dark is now my second nature, it only took me about 10 minutes to get all set for the night.</p>\n<p>I didn’t get much sleep. Not sure if it was the excitement of an adventure, anxiety about ruined plans, or something else entirely, but I woke up groggy and sore. I refilled my water, had breakfast, and spent probably an hour just relaxing, enjoying nature, and not doing jack squat. At this point, I made an executive decision to hike to lake Valhalla and reassess my options. Should I hike further?

I've taken a whole week off work to do this hike and apparently it took me over a week to come up with a sensible story about it. This is a long one, so bear with me. Or don't.\n\nThe idea to hike the Loowit Trail came to me way back, probably, around 2013, when my family and I visited Johnston Ridge Observatory.\n\n![Photo of Mt. Loowit I've taken from Johnston Ridge Observatory on June 8, 2013](assets/blog/posts/loowit-trail/IMG_2715.jpg)\n\nI learned that there was a hiking trail right at the bottom of the breached side of the volcano, and I had this trail in mind ever since.\n\n## Mt. Loowit (St. Helens)\n\n![Before 1980 eruption](assets/blog/posts/loowit-trail/4dd5841ec27882fca505ff12ed44ad348061da47-748x500.jpg)\n\n> Throughout this post, sometimes I will refer to Mt. St. Helens by its native name, Loowit (Lawetlat'la, Loowit or Louwala-Clough to be precise). For centuries, the mountain had its name, but colonizers in their infinite arrogance decided to give it a new name. In 1792 Commander George Vancouver named this landmark after his friend British diplomat Alleyne Fitzherbert, 1st Baron St Helens.\n\nMt. Loowit is the youngest volcano in the Cascades. It is located on the indigenous lands of [Cowlitz](https://www.cowlitz.org/) and Klickitat native people (now part of [Yakama Nation](http://www.yakamanation.org/)). The slopes of the mountain above the treeline are a Traditional Cultural Property of Cowlitz and Yakama tribal groups. For thousands of years, the mountain has been a central place in the culture and mythology of the tribes, where resources were gathered and young people were sent to test themselves.\n\nAlthough I only ventured above the \"treeline\" once or twice along the Loowit trail, I can clearly see why this incredible place is at the center of indigenous cultures. I encourage you to take a look at some of the legends collected and passed down through generations.\n\n## May 18, 1980\n\nPrior to May 18, 1980, Mt. St. Helens was a beautiful cone-shaped peak, sometimes referred to as Mt. Fuji of the Pacific Northwest. It all changed early on that day. There are a few fantastic documentaries about the infamous eruption and the subsequent largest landslide in recorded history.\n\n<iframe\n  width=\"100%\"\n  height=\"400\"\n  src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/forP1N1XwYE\"\n  frameBorder=\"0\"\n  allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\"\n  allowFullScreen\n  className=\"my-5\"\n></iframe>\n\n<iframe\n  width=\"100%\"\n  height=\"400\"\n  src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/fArB5Jz2wos\"\n  frameBorder=\"0\"\n  allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\"\n  allowFullScreen\n  className=\"my-5\"\n></iframe>\n\n<iframe\n  width=\"100%\"\n  height=\"400\"\n  src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/4L1N-FDrGLk\"\n  frameBorder=\"0\"\n  allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\"\n  allowFullScreen\n  className=\"my-5\"\n></iframe>\n\nEver since the eruption, Mt. St. Helens fascinated scientists, hikers, photographers, writers and became a preserved natural treasure.\n\n## The trail\n\nOf course, there's a hiking trail around the volcano, it's PNW, what did you expect?! :)\n\nThe Loowit Trail circles the mountain at about 4400 ft of elevation, sometimes dipping as low as 2900 ft and soaring to over 4800 ft. Its length depends a lot on the approach, but generally, it's considered to be between 30 and 35 miles, with a total elevation gain of around 9000 ft.\n\n![No camping between markers 11 and 20](assets/blog/posts/loowit-trail/0c3bba4d73f36dd1580f49c1b5c8bb003c9a52cc-1600x1472.jpg)\n\nThe trail is considered to be `Difficult` to `Expert` level, and for a good reason: it throws every possible terrain and challenge at you, all the time! I don't know what I was thinking when I decided that I should totally hike it: I'm not in great physical shape and my backpacking experience prior to this hike was limited to 2-nighters. Anyway, I was set on hiking it during my time off, and when I'm set on an adventure, nothing can stop me (except for a broken leg, evidently)\n\n## Preparation\n\nFor this hike, I went all-in on ultralight gear. Ultralight tent, ultralight quilt, ultralight sleeping pad, ultralight backpack, the list goes on. I trimmed my base weight to about 12 pounds, which is quite fascinating if you ask me. I also had 2 65 oz bottles for water and another 2-liter water bag.\n\n![Gear](assets/blog/posts/loowit-trail/7657b74380fad6e261c83d852e123f00111ddf42-667x1179.jpg)\n\nSo on the gear front, I was well-prepared and ready to go. Some things that I've taken with me I hadn't used a lot or even at all, but those were minor and inconsequential.\n\nI was not as prepared physically as I thought I was but will get to it.\n\n![Day Zero](assets/blog/posts/loowit-trail/1e0e8b9878755c60f9846140adc7684de1857e1e-1024x768.jpg)\n\nOn Sunday, I arrived at Climbers Bivouac, set up my tent, quickly drove to Portland to pay my respects to the folks protesting in front of the Injustice Center. I got back to the camp after dark and went straight to sleep. Tomorrow was going to be a long day.\n\n## Day one\n\nI got up pretty late — most climbers were long gone. The weather was perfect for me: low overcast, fairly chilly, and quiet.\n\n![Ready to go!](assets/blog/posts/loowit-trail/a81803fa03fbb3b86d832916bbd6e962913c5f36-768x1024.jpg)\n\nThe first segment of the hike is the approach to the Loowit Trail. To get to the trail from the camp, you need to hike up Ptarmigan trail for about two miles and something like 700 ft of elevation, until you hit an intersection with Loowit trail. There, I took a right turn and proceeded counter-clockwise.\n\n![The mountain is looming ahead. Trust me!](assets/blog/posts/loowit-trail/2d2c8095112e718f0025091647f014f01a099f6c-768x1024.jpg)\n\nThe trail was fairly light for the first few miles. It mostly went downhill, and the climbing segments were fairly light. The views were already quite impressive, especially if you consider that there's a looming volcano behind the clouds!\n\n![Mt St Helens](assets/blog/posts/loowit-trail/0e1698f000957f29cbd012aaaf5e7cacddabd5a1-1024x768.jpg)\n\nThis first part of the trail, approximately between Climbers to Windy Pass has quite a few water sources, and it gave me a false impression that water is not going to be a problem. Yes, this water was silty and muddy, but it's water so who cares, right?!\n\n![Chocolate Falls creek (?) slicing through lava](assets/blog/posts/loowit-trail/4498c440edffb7df9921260d4654814ae963bcd0-768x1024.jpg)\n\n![Chocolate Falls](assets/blog/posts/loowit-trail/0d8fbd7436621e42a878ab2d6049392b8eda9f6a-768x1024.jpg)\n\nI topped up my water containers here at the Chocolate falls and hit my first challenging segment: Worm Flows. This is basically a giant lava boulder field you need to cross. The trail is non-existent, and you hop from boulder to boulder navigating to the next white stake in the distance.\n\n![Worm Flows are the worst!](assets/blog/posts/loowit-trail/e2879f48fab64ff47a7fc482a7bfe0b7a058fd7e-1024x768.jpg)\n\n![Chocolate falls in the distance](assets/blog/posts/loowit-trail/2da839ae1c1b3b3c0f788e27dc3dbaec5c4a0e82-1024x768.jpg)\n\nThe day was going towards sunset at this point, so I pushed forward to hit my Day One target (about 7 miles) and set up camp for the night before dark.\n\n![Camping in a forest](assets/blog/posts/loowit-trail/4ba7efc743d0a9f53a4e62af07a62ca42712d98c-1024x768.jpg)\n\nAnd there you have it. Day one was in the books, I felt pretty good about my progress and the fact that I hit my first target. There were some wild animals sniffing around the tent all night, but nothing interesting happened, and I didn't find any interesting footprints in the morning.\n\n## Day two\n\nWhen you backpack for days, at some point it's easy to sync with the sun. You wake up around sunrise and normally settle down for the night right after sunset. At least that's my experience.\n\nDay two began early: I had about 6-8 miles to hike through pretty rugged terrain and under full sun and clear skies. My goal was to push all the way to Windy Pass — the edge of the Restricted zone in front of the Breach — the part of the mountain that got destroyed during the eruption.\n\n![Mt Pahto/Klickitat (Adams) and Mt Wy'East (Hood)](assets/blog/posts/loowit-trail/2905aeefc27501d99cfa4e583f956dfb35633ff5-1201x654.jpg)\n\nAs mentioned before, the terrain on this stretch of the trail is pretty rough. Looking back, it's not _that_ rough, especially compared to some later segments.\n\nThe views were breathtaking. I paused every now and again just to stare in the distance, taking it in as much as I can.\n\n![Breathtaking landscape with Mt. Wy'East (Hood) in the distance](assets/blog/posts/loowit-trail/adcfad7efa050cec2acfd4ecd6e7823949bd1cdd-1024x768.jpg)\n\nRugged boulder fields turned into a huge stretch of huckleberry fields. Quite literally, you're making your way on a narrow trail slicing an endless huckleberry field! The berries were ripe, juicy and so very tasty!\n\n![Huckleberry fields!](assets/blog/posts/loowit-trail/bf0af882a8a55ab0d9681a94bd52789931c2565b-1024x768.jpg)\n\nI was getting pretty tired. All these uphills, boulders, lack of shade began to take tall. I refilled my water at Muddy River, and realized that I'm probably not going to make it to my target area before sunset.\n\n![Muddy River](assets/blog/posts/loowit-trail/c4cdea1eee98da00785034895c0f10840909c363-1024x768.jpg)\n\n![Muddy River](assets/blog/posts/loowit-trail/940ed8af08ae7437c2c44aa2d08906dccbc48ef8-1024x768.jpg)\n\nI pushed forward for as long as I could. The problem was that since I was tired, hot, and pushing, I drank a lot of water. And I was running out fairly quickly. I decided that I'll go until I find a water source and will break camp somewhere nearby.\n\nI use [Gaia GPS](https://www.gaiagps.com/) as my primary navigation app, and I truly love it. Aside from providing 100s of map layers (including cell coverage, air quality, and more), it has some unique data I relied on in this trip: campsites.\n\n![GAIA](assets/blog/posts/loowit-trail/a0a9d0e431139c2fea62226e113c98ea8570a7d6-1125x2436.jpg)\n\nI was lucky enough to chat with a fellow hiker who let me know that the creek that looks to be running by the campsite here, in fact, changed and is now running quite a bit to the West. This spot became my new goal for the day.\n\nI arrived at the campsite right before sunset, set up a tent, enjoyed the view for a bit, and went to sleep.\n\n## Day three\n\nWhen this is what you wake up to, the day just can't be bad!\n\n![Waking up to this... Not bad at all!](assets/blog/posts/loowit-trail/1b327586fa99450e69830eb252e863e817e52ec9-1024x768.jpg)\n\n![View](assets/blog/posts/loowit-trail/0bceaef86f87d5a26f62ec03a777da7294bb5614-1024x768.jpg)\n\n![Mt. Pahto/Klickitat (Adams)](assets/blog/posts/loowit-trail/f5f59e06d0ac3ebaee567e3398b594b343daec49-1024x768.jpg)\n\nI think now is a good time to mention a few things that very clearly went wrong by this point:\n\n- I was running out of water much faster than I could find water sources.\n- I somehow punctured my inflatable sleeping pad and despite my repair efforts, it was deflating almost completely within 1-2 hours. My back wasn't happy about this, and sleep quality got pretty low.\n- The food I brought with me was either dehydrated or too sweet for me to hold. By this point in time, I haven't eaten much in the past 2 days, yet it didn't bother me yet\n- I was running ~3 miles behind schedule. With a Restricted Zone looming ahead — you must cross it's ~9 miles in one go, no camping allowed — I will have to cover these 3 miles and 9 miles of the Restricted zone today in order to camp legally. 12 miles is ok on easier trails, but by this time I realized that 12 miles in one day on this trail is probably beyond my abilities.\n\nWith all this in mind, I embarked on this most exciting part of the trail — the one that crosses the Breach and pumice fields left in front of the mountain by the 1980 blast and subsequent landslide.\n\nThe first few miles from my camp to Windy Pass were a breeze. The mostly flat prairie-like trail all the way to the pass. I enjoyed my walk a lot, and was wondering for a while whether I could've made it the day before. I probably could have pushed for a few more miles, break camp after dark beside the Windy Pass and shave these extra miles off of my Restricted Zone day.\n\n![Approaching Windy Pass. Mt Tahoma (Rainier) in the distance.](assets/blog/posts/loowit-trail/0a4f52dde5263f97648adbf7f41ccff1f128e260-1024x768.jpg)\n\n![Windy Pass: I'd need to cross it and get to the other side](assets/blog/posts/loowit-trail/1e867df37d7f5f090db7d07cfe45f072fcd7ab3a-1024x768.jpg)\n\nGoing over the pass look intimidating at first, but was in fact fairly easy. The trail there goes along the hillside and is not very stable and has a few really sketchy spots, but overall it was easier than I expected.\n\n![At the top of Windy Pass with Wy'East (Hood) in the distance](assets/blog/posts/loowit-trail/c9906515cfc026b09b7c69d872825474d0d706cf-1024x768.jpg)\n\nThe following few miles go over the side of the mountain slowly introducing the Breach — the side of the volcano destroyed by the blast in 1980. For me, this was the most exciting part of the journey. Walking on top of many feet of fairly new volcanic ash, seeing the destruction side of the volcano myself, and traversing many canyons, streams, and erosion areas while seeing the mountain at a very unusual angle.\n\n![View](assets/blog/posts/loowit-trail/a5abc4813fff331720579cca52c72832ae681b28-1024x768.jpg)\n\n![View](assets/blog/posts/loowit-trail/07178ff14dc2b8559103b417e3f501d952f53669-1024x768.jpg)\n\n![Here she is, peak-less mountain in all its glory](assets/blog/posts/loowit-trail/84c5e51cc66db5f8dbc321a019c33a317aad7a1d-1024x768.jpg)\n\nIt's been 40+ years since the eruption, yet the mountain is still settling in. Constant rock fall noise, steam, and ash floating in the air, ever-changing streams and riverbeds — it will likely take hundreds of years for all this stuff to calm down. Geologically speaking, 40 years is nothing, a blink of an eye, so from the volcano's perspective, it just erupted moments ago and the process of healing hasn't even started yet. Biologically, though, even in the blast zone, life is everywhere. From grass and weeds to all sorts of shrubs and sub-alpine flowers and native trees, it's all here. Chipmunks, coyotes, birds of every color, elk, and deer, it's all here.\n\nTo say that this is an active and dangerous volcano would be an understatement. In the past 30 days, there were close to a dozen earthquakes under Mt St Helens, and every year there periods of swarm earthquakes: dozens of magnitude 1-3 shakes that happen within days and weeks. Something is still going on down there, and at any point, the mountain can start erupting again (the same way it happened twice in 2006 and then in 2008).\n\n![Me](assets/blog/posts/loowit-trail/e55d5bf98c36c141936585f45b5c88fe8a066653-1022x768.jpg)\n\nThis is the heart of the blast zone. Behind me is the gaping wound left by the eruption. You can't hear rocks falling, but you can see clouds of ash they send up in the air.\n\nBy this point, I'm exhausted. A few miles back, I hit an oasis: a little stream, ice-cold and absolutely clear, surrounded by some trees and bushes. I refilled all my water containers, relaxed in the shade for a bit, and pushed forward through the blast zone.\n\n![This is what it looks like to stand in front of a gaping crater of an active volcano](assets/blog/posts/loowit-trail/f28d806b1d36ad2e8410841c09c839fdd37fa590-1293x608.jpg)\n\nMy goal for the day was to get to the South Fork Toutle River — the next water source and the place where the restricted zone ends and camping is allowed again.\n\nBy the time I left the breach area, I was at the end of my rope: I was tired, I practically ran out of water, and I still had about 4 miles ahead of me to get to Toutle River. There was no way I'd make it there, and it was time to admit it and plan accordingly.\n\n![Leaving the breach zone](assets/blog/posts/loowit-trail/e424d0239c5aa2d55d05ce17027a9139bcdb9256-1024x768.jpg)\n\nI decided to push as far as I humanly can, again. With canyons turning deeper and deeper, and hiking mostly uphill at this point, this \"as far as humanly possible\" turned out to be about 2 miles or so. I found a spot (still in the restricted area) and pitched my tent — there was no way I'd cross this canyon today. I fell asleep almost immediately.\n\nBy this time, I had exactly two sips of water left and 2 miles to hike up and down to the next water source. I was in trouble.\n\n![Illegal camping in the Restricted zone. I'm sorry :(](assets/blog/posts/loowit-trail/c121405b6e82577acc01dcefadbebc85cce4938c-1093x718.jpg)\n\n## Day four\n\nThis was one of those days when you think: \"Ok, how can I quit this now?\" And the answer is, basically, you can't. At this point, there's no exit from the trail that would take you to people faster. There's no way around the upcoming Toutle Drop (I'll get to it in a minute). There's no quitting, only pushing ahead and hoping you can make it, which at this point was not a sure thing.\n\nI had my sip of water for breakfast and hit the trail. Since I haven't eaten much and started to get fairly dehydrated, I got to the point of being slightly delirious. I had to take breaks every few hundred yards — taking my pack off, spreading my sleeping pad, and just laying down for a few minutes. The next 2 miles were the longest two miles in my life.\n\nLuckily, I met another hiker, who was generous enough to share half a bottle of water with me. I've taken a picture of him on his phone in return, and was incredibly grateful for the water and some tips on what awaits me ahead.\n\nAhead was the Toutle Drop. I don't think it's an official name of this feature, but every hiker I've met referred to it like this.\n\n![Toutle River down below](assets/blog/posts/loowit-trail/fc7a46e9765305362cfbb19753635db862f77d37-1131x695.jpg)\n\nRight there, at the very bottom of this by far the deepest canyon on the trail, there is a tiny stream. It's Toutle River, and in fact, it's not so tiny, it's just very far below.\n\nThe Drop is a sharp descent over a slope of the canyon. You go down on loose pomace and volcanic ash. One sloppy or unsteady step, and you will lose your footing and tumble hundreds of feet down to the bottom of the canyon.\n\n![Map](assets/blog/posts/loowit-trail/403784db89e8a7147ae4c72fff34bb1918717ea4-1600x1272.jpg)\n\nBy the time I got to the final ~30 feet rope-climb down to the river, I was set on spending the rest of my day right there, by the water. All the water I can drink! Flowing, roaring, splashing! Sweet, sweet unlimited water!\n\n![Toutle River](assets/blog/posts/loowit-trail/59fef8b7e923e16c5616fbe834f711593fe78704-1024x768.jpg)\n\nI spent about 3 hours by the river. There was not a spot of shade, so I covered myself with my sleeping mat, and just laid there for hours, drifting asleep, hot and tired. Every now and again, I'd go and refill my water bottle, drink it all, doze off for a bit and repeat. I even ate half of one of my sweet food items: even if I can't hold it and vomit it right away, at least I'd have enough water to recover quickly. It went fairly well, and provided some necessary calories and a slight energy boost.\n\n![Unlimited water!](assets/blog/posts/loowit-trail/26ff8575a440eafcaf803f037ace2aee6963e0df-768x1024.jpg)\n\nIn front of me was a daunting uphill stretch of over 2000 ft of elevation. Also, there was an intersection where I could attempt to exit the trail: I could hike lower, take a trail that goes parallel to Loowit trail, and pop out at a road leading to the Climbers Bivouac. By my estimations, this path was about a mile longer but offered fewer elevation changes. The biggest downside was that the final mile or so was a roughly 1000 ft ascent, overall elevation gain would be approximately the same as at Loowit trail, and this other trail was unlikely to have any hiker traffic in case I pass out. At this stage of my hike, passing out became a real concern, and I had to keep it in mind.\n\n![Toutle River](assets/blog/posts/loowit-trail/5fd723d376224f8cbc98375087c74f959b08aaa0-1024x768.jpg)\n\nI refilled my water containers for the last time: there will be no water for the next 8+ miles. Basically, there will be no water all the way to the trailhead parking. Or so I thought. I took another nap at the campground just above the river, and made an executive decision to attempt to exit the trail by taking this other trail I described above. There will still be a chance to return back to the Loowit trail later without losing anything.\n\nI hiked for a couple of miles through the forest and set up camp right over a river beside a sturdy bridge over Sheep Canyon. It was a relief to find more water: it meant that I could have all the water I want for breakfast and refill once more before the final push to the parking lot. I was very much set on finishing tomorrow, no matter what.\n\n## Day five\n\nI woke up early and was in a good mood. I was still weak, exhausted, and ached all over from sleeping on a deflated sleeping pad, but it was my last day on the trail. The plan was this: I hike to the trailhead, get into my car, drive to Vancouver, WA, eat Wendy's Double Baconator and gulp a large diet Vanilla Ginger Ale, spend the night at a nice hotel, take a shower and do the laundry, and drive home the next morning.\n\nMotivation, unfortunately, is not enough for pushing through 8 miles of very challenging mountain terrain. I've barely eaten in 5 days, poorly hydrated, sore all over; the sun is mercilessly shining, deep canyons with rope climbing and another set of lava boulder fields lie ahead.\n\nHonestly, I remember very little about this day. I remember taking long breaks every few hundred yards. Just laying down for a few minutes (hours?), rationing water, and dreaming about Vanilla Ginger Ale.\n\nI set myself a miles countdown: 2 miles before the parking lot, I'd hit the approach trail — 2 miles of 100% downhill. So I subtracted these 2 miles from whatever milage I had left. Roughly speaking, I just needed to push through about 6 miles of the trail to get to this final trail intersection and then just descent to the parking lot.\n\n![View](assets/blog/posts/loowit-trail/dcd871d4d6b3a8391811546495025dc9891aadfb-1024x768.jpg)\n\n...Of course, I ran out of water about 3 miles before my target intersection.\n\n...At sunset, I met two hikers who shared some water with me, and strongly suggested I spend the night in a little patch of trees right ahead of me: attempting to cross another boulder field at night in my condition concerned them gravely, and I concurred. I crossed a patch of boulders, entered a tree patch, spotted a tiny opening besides the trail, and set there for the night. Words \"Cowboy camping\" popped into my clouded mind, and given that was pretty much unable to think straight or do much, I decided to give it a shot. Cowboy camping is, basically, camping without a tent. You just unroll your sleeping mat, lay down, and sleep under the stars. Not in a nice hotel after a double baconator as planned, but right there in the bushes, with one of my dry sacks as a pillow and with a buff covering my face and ears from insects.\n\nIn all honesty, it wasn't too bad. And the night sky was absolutely, incredibly covered with stars with Milky Way visible so clearly, I didn't know it was even possible to see it like this. As for the insects — my biggest concern — aside from a few random ants crossing my legs a few times, no one bothered me.\n\n## Finale\n\nWell, this Saturday **had** to be my last day. With just about 2-3 miles to the parking lot trail and 2 miles of downhill, I had to make it there today. I woke up at about 6 o'clock, and by then I knew what to expect. In a few minutes, runners will start passing by. About an hour or so later, I'll meet the first hikers. In about 2 hours, I'll meet the majority of people who started the trail today. By this time, all of it was clear and very predictable. I got up stuffed my dew-soaked quilt into the pack and started my final hike.\n\nI ran out of water pretty quickly. I didn't have much to begin with, probably 4 or 5 sips, and the adventures of the week took their toll — I **had** to drink. I met a few people in the next mile or so, mostly runners, and you don't ask runners for water: they are on the clock, and they have smaller water reserves. I was lucky, again, to meet a fellow hiker who looked at me after I asked for a sip of water and just refilled my whole bottle. He explained that he's been in a similar situation more than once, and it was time for him to pay it forward. I was so grateful! A full bottle of water! I drank half of it within minutes :)\n\nCrossing the last boulder field, dried out Swift creek, and — finally — here's the intersection with a trail going downhill to the parking lot! I made it!\n\nAbout an hour later, I put my backpack in the trunk of my car and left Climbers Bivouac. Alive, hungry, dehydrated, sore, and aching all over, dirty but happy that I made it.\n\n## Lessons Learned\n\n- Dehydrated food is nice, but it's useless without water. The same goes for sweet food. Also, always test any new trail food before taking it with you. There's a chance you are not compatible with it.\n- Fewer _moving parts_ next time: no inflatable sleeping pad — no problem. No stove, no problem. You get the idea.\n- Water planning and management are key. Especially if you drink a lot. Consider trails with water readily available instead of hiking trails known for their long dry stretches.\n- Cowboy camping is ok. Not a fan, but it's totally an option in an open space. Wouldn't do it in a forest, though.\n- If you're set on a trail that you think maybe more challenging than what you can handle, consider your exit strategy. More than once I thought about exiting the trail. And every time I convinced myself that I shouldn't. If I had a clear strategy of when, where, why, and how I could exit, I'd probably cut the trip short but also wouldn't suffer as much :)\n- Have your location beacon ready. More than once I was this close to pushing the SOS button and just giving up. I passed out a few times and had difficulty standing up, and thought that this is it, an SOS situation. Ironically, it gave me a sense of confidence: well, I can always call for help, so let me just try and push a bit further, and if I absolutely cannot move anymore, I'll do the SOS thing. I never did, of course, but this option was very much on the table.\n\n## Now what?\n\nFor about 3 days after I got back home, I was recovering from severe dehydration and also eating like crazy. I bought a watermelon, a bunch of grapes, and a ton of other juicy fruit. I drank a lot, and it's hard to appreciate tap water enough until you have no access to water for days. All things considered, I recovered fairly quickly. But I still haven't unpacked my backpack.\n\nFor about a week after my return home, I was absolutely, 100% done with backpacking forever. Never again will I voluntarily subject myself to this kind of experience! **NEVER!**\n\nAbout 2 weeks later, as I finishing this story, I'm thinking about where can I go next? What short, 1-2-night hike is easy enough yet interesting and exciting? And as of the time of this writing, I've got a few ideas ;) But to be completely honest, my 2020 backpacking season is probably over. I'm likely to take a few day hikes, an overnight maybe, but that's about it.

I’ve taken a whole week off work to do this hike and apparently it took me over a week to come up with a sensible story about it. This is a long one, so bear with me. Or don’t.</p>\n<p>The idea to hike the Loowit Trail came to me way back, probably, around 2013, when my family and I visited Johnston Ridge Observatory.</p>\n<p><img __ASTRO_IMAGE_=\"{&#x22;src&#x22;:&#x22;assets/blog/posts/loowit-trail/IMG_2715.jpg&#x22;,&#x22;alt&#x22;:&#x22;Photo of Mt.

Loowit (St. Helens)</h2>\n<p><img __ASTRO_IMAGE_=\"{&#x22;src&#x22;:&#x22;assets/blog/posts/loowit-trail/4dd5841ec27882fca505ff12ed44ad348061da47-748x500.jpg&#x22;,&#x22;alt&#x22;:&#x22;Before 1980 eruption&#x22;,&#x22;index&#x22;:0}\"></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Throughout this post, sometimes I will refer to Mt. St. Helens by its native name, Loowit (Lawetlat’la, Loowit or Louwala-Clough to be precise). For centuries, the mountain had its name, but colonizers in their infinite arrogance decided to give it a new name. In 1792 Commander George Vancouver named this landmark after his friend British diplomat Alleyne Fitzherbert, 1st Baron St Helens.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Mt. Loowit is the youngest volcano in the Cascades. It is located on the indigenous lands of <a href=\"https://www.cowlitz.org/\">Cowlitz</a> and Klickitat native people (now part of <a href=\"http://www.yakamanation.org/\">Yakama Nation</a>). The slopes of the mountain above the treeline are a Traditional Cultural Property of Cowlitz and Yakama tribal groups. For thousands of years, the mountain has been a central place in the culture and mythology of the tribes, where resources were gathered and young people were sent to test themselves.</p>\n<p>Although I only ventured above the “treeline” once or twice along the Loowit trail, I can clearly see why this incredible place is at the center of indigenous cultures. I encourage you to take a look at some of the legends collected and passed down through generations.</p>\n<h2 id=\"may-18-1980\">May 18, 1980</h2>\n<p>Prior to May 18, 1980, Mt. St. Helens was a beautiful cone-shaped peak, sometimes referred to as Mt. Fuji of the Pacific Northwest. It all changed early on that day. There are a few fantastic documentaries about the infamous eruption and the subsequent largest landslide in recorded history.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"400\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/forP1N1XwYE\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen class=\"my-5\"></iframe>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"400\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/fArB5Jz2wos\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen class=\"my-5\"></iframe>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"400\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/4L1N-FDrGLk\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen class=\"my-5\"></iframe>\n<p>Ever since the eruption, Mt.

Its length depends a lot on the approach, but generally, it’s considered to be between 30 and 35 miles, with a total elevation gain of around 9000 ft.</p>\n<p><img __ASTRO_IMAGE_=\"{&#x22;src&#x22;:&#x22;assets/blog/posts/loowit-trail/0c3bba4d73f36dd1580f49c1b5c8bb003c9a52cc-1600x1472.jpg&#x22;,&#x22;alt&#x22;:&#x22;No camping between markers 11 and 20&#x22;,&#x22;index&#x22;:0}\"></p>\n<p>The trail is considered to be <code>Difficult</code> to <code>Expert</code> level, and for a good reason: it throws every possible terrain and challenge at you, all the time! I don’t know what I was thinking when I decided that I should totally hike it: I’m not in great physical shape and my backpacking experience prior to this hike was limited to 2-nighters. Anyway, I was set on hiking it during my time off, and when I’m set on an adventure, nothing can stop me (except for a broken leg, evidently)</p>\n<h2 id=\"preparation\">Preparation</h2>\n<p>For this hike, I went all-in on ultralight gear. Ultralight tent, ultralight quilt, ultralight sleeping pad, ultralight backpack, the list goes on. I trimmed my base weight to about 12 pounds, which is quite fascinating if you ask me. I also had 2 65 oz bottles for water and another 2-liter water bag.</p>\n<p><img __ASTRO_IMAGE_=\"{&#x22;src&#x22;:&#x22;assets/blog/posts/loowit-trail/7657b74380fad6e261c83d852e123f00111ddf42-667x1179.jpg&#x22;,&#x22;alt&#x22;:&#x22;Gear&#x22;,&#x22;index&#x22;:0}\"></p>\n<p>So on the gear front, I was well-prepared and ready to go. Some things that I’ve taken with me I hadn’t used a lot or even at all, but those were minor and inconsequential.</p>\n<p>I was not as prepared physically as I thought I was but will get to it.</p>\n<p><img __ASTRO_IMAGE_=\"{&#x22;src&#x22;:&#x22;assets/blog/posts/loowit-trail/1e0e8b9878755c60f9846140adc7684de1857e1e-1024x768.jpg&#x22;,&#x22;alt&#x22;:&#x22;Day Zero&#x22;,&#x22;index&#x22;:0}\"></p>\n<p>On Sunday, I arrived at Climbers Bivouac, set up my tent, quickly drove to Portland to pay my respects to the folks protesting in front of the Injustice Center. I got back to the camp after dark and went straight to sleep. Tomorrow was going to be a long day.</p>\n<h2 id=\"day-one\">Day one</h2>\n<p>I got up pretty late — most climbers were long gone. The weather was perfect for me: low overcast, fairly chilly, and quiet.</p>\n<p><img __ASTRO_IMAGE_=\"{&#x22;src&#x22;:&#x22;assets/blog/posts/loowit-trail/a81803fa03fbb3b86d832916bbd6e962913c5f36-768x1024.jpg&#x22;,&#x22;alt&#x22;:&#x22;Ready to go!&#x22;,&#x22;index&#x22;:0}\"></p>\n<p>The first segment of the hike is the approach to the Loowit Trail. To get to the trail from the camp, you need to hike up Ptarmigan trail for about two miles and something like 700 ft of elevation, until you hit an intersection with Loowit trail. There, I took a right turn and proceeded counter-clockwise.</p>\n<p><img __ASTRO_IMAGE_=\"{&#x22;src&#x22;:&#x22;assets/blog/posts/loowit-trail/2d2c8095112e718f0025091647f014f01a099f6c-768x1024.jpg&#x22;,&#x22;alt&#x22;:&#x22;The mountain is looming ahead.

Day one was in the books, I felt pretty good about my progress and the fact that I hit my first target. There were some wild animals sniffing around the tent all night, but nothing interesting happened, and I didn’t find any interesting footprints in the morning.</p>\n<h2 id=\"day-two\">Day two</h2>\n<p>When you backpack for days, at some point it’s easy to sync with the sun. You wake up around sunrise and normally settle down for the night right after sunset. At least that’s my experience.</p>\n<p>Day two began early: I had about 6-8 miles to hike through pretty rugged terrain and under full sun and clear skies. My goal was to push all the way to Windy Pass — the edge of the Restricted zone in front of the Breach — the part of the mountain that got destroyed during the eruption.</p>\n<p><img __ASTRO_IMAGE_=\"{&#x22;src&#x22;:&#x22;assets/blog/posts/loowit-trail/2905aeefc27501d99cfa4e583f956dfb35633ff5-1201x654.jpg&#x22;,&#x22;alt&#x22;:&#x22;Mt Pahto/Klickitat (Adams) and Mt Wy&#x27;East (Hood)&#x22;,&#x22;index&#x22;:0}\"></p>\n<p>As mentioned before, the terrain on this stretch of the trail is pretty rough.

The problem was that since I was tired, hot, and pushing, I drank a lot of water. And I was running out fairly quickly.

With a Restricted Zone looming ahead — you must cross it’s ~9 miles in one go, no camping allowed — I will have to cover these 3 miles and 9 miles of the Restricted zone today in order to camp legally. 12 miles is ok on easier trails, but by this time I realized that 12 miles in one day on this trail is probably beyond my abilities.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>With all this in mind, I embarked on this most exciting part of the trail — the one that crosses the Breach and pumice fields left in front of the mountain by the 1980 blast and subsequent landslide.</p>\n<p>The first few miles from my camp to Windy Pass were a breeze. The mostly flat prairie-like trail all the way to the pass. I enjoyed my walk a lot, and was wondering for a while whether I could’ve made it the day before. I probably could have pushed for a few more miles, break camp after dark beside the Windy Pass and shave these extra miles off of my Restricted Zone day.</p>\n<p><img __ASTRO_IMAGE_=\"{&#x22;src&#x22;:&#x22;assets/blog/posts/loowit-trail/0a4f52dde5263f97648adbf7f41ccff1f128e260-1024x768.jpg&#x22;,&#x22;alt&#x22;:&#x22;Approaching Windy Pass.

The trail there goes along the hillside and is not very stable and has a few really sketchy spots, but overall it was easier than I expected.</p>\n<p><img __ASTRO_IMAGE_=\"{&#x22;src&#x22;:&#x22;assets/blog/posts/loowit-trail/c9906515cfc026b09b7c69d872825474d0d706cf-1024x768.jpg&#x22;,&#x22;alt&#x22;:&#x22;At the top of Windy Pass with Wy&#x27;East (Hood) in the distance&#x22;,&#x22;index&#x22;:0}\"></p>\n<p>The following few miles go over the side of the mountain slowly introducing the Breach — the side of the volcano destroyed by the blast in 1980. For me, this was the most exciting part of the journey. Walking on top of many feet of fairly new volcanic ash, seeing the destruction side of the volcano myself, and traversing many canyons, streams, and erosion areas while seeing the mountain at a very unusual angle.</p>\n<p><img __ASTRO_IMAGE_=\"{&#x22;src&#x22;:&#x22;assets/blog/posts/loowit-trail/a5abc4813fff331720579cca52c72832ae681b28-1024x768.jpg&#x22;,&#x22;alt&#x22;:&#x22;View&#x22;,&#x22;index&#x22;:0}\"></p>\n<p><img __ASTRO_IMAGE_=\"{&#x22;src&#x22;:&#x22;assets/blog/posts/loowit-trail/07178ff14dc2b8559103b417e3f501d952f53669-1024x768.jpg&#x22;,&#x22;alt&#x22;:&#x22;View&#x22;,&#x22;index&#x22;:0}\"></p>\n<p><img __ASTRO_IMAGE_=\"{&#x22;src&#x22;:&#x22;assets/blog/posts/loowit-trail/84c5e51cc66db5f8dbc321a019c33a317aad7a1d-1024x768.jpg&#x22;,&#x22;alt&#x22;:&#x22;Here she is, peak-less mountain in all its glory&#x22;,&#x22;index&#x22;:0}\"></p>\n<p>It’s been 40+ years since the eruption, yet the mountain is still settling in. Constant rock fall noise, steam, and ash floating in the air, ever-changing streams and riverbeds — it will likely take hundreds of years for all this stuff to calm down. Geologically speaking, 40 years is nothing, a blink of an eye, so from the volcano’s perspective, it just erupted moments ago and the process of healing hasn’t even started yet. Biologically, though, even in the blast zone, life is everywhere. From grass and weeds to all sorts of shrubs and sub-alpine flowers and native trees, it’s all here. Chipmunks, coyotes, birds of every color, elk, and deer, it’s all here.</p>\n<p>To say that this is an active and dangerous volcano would be an understatement. In the past 30 days, there were close to a dozen earthquakes under Mt St Helens, and every year there periods of swarm earthquakes: dozens of magnitude 1-3 shakes that happen within days and weeks. Something is still going on down there, and at any point, the mountain can start erupting again (the same way it happened twice in 2006 and then in 2008).</p>\n<p><img __ASTRO_IMAGE_=\"{&#x22;src&#x22;:&#x22;assets/blog/posts/loowit-trail/e55d5bf98c36c141936585f45b5c88fe8a066653-1022x768.jpg&#x22;,&#x22;alt&#x22;:&#x22;Me&#x22;,&#x22;index&#x22;:0}\"></p>\n<p>This is the heart of the blast zone. Behind me is the gaping wound left by the eruption. You can’t hear rocks falling, but you can see clouds of ash they send up in the air.</p>\n<p>By this point, I’m exhausted. A few miles back, I hit an oasis: a little stream, ice-cold and absolutely clear, surrounded by some trees and bushes. I refilled all my water containers, relaxed in the shade for a bit, and pushed forward through the blast zone.</p>\n<p><img __ASTRO_IMAGE_=\"{&#x22;src&#x22;:&#x22;assets/blog/posts/loowit-trail/f28d806b1d36ad2e8410841c09c839fdd37fa590-1293x608.jpg&#x22;,&#x22;alt&#x22;:&#x22;This is what it looks like to stand in front of a gaping crater of an active volcano&#x22;,&#x22;index&#x22;:0}\"></p>\n<p>My goal for the day was to get to the South Fork Toutle River — the next water source and the place where the restricted zone ends and camping is allowed again.</p>\n<p>By the time I left the breach area, I was at the end of my rope: I was tired, I practically ran out of water, and I still had about 4 miles ahead of me to get to Toutle River. There was no way I’d make it there, and it was time to admit it and plan accordingly.</p>\n<p><img __ASTRO_IMAGE_=\"{&#x22;src&#x22;:&#x22;assets/blog/posts/loowit-trail/e424d0239c5aa2d55d05ce17027a9139bcdb9256-1024x768.jpg&#x22;,&#x22;alt&#x22;:&#x22;Leaving the breach zone&#x22;,&#x22;index&#x22;:0}\"></p>\n<p>I decided to push as far as I humanly can, again. With canyons turning deeper and deeper, and hiking mostly uphill at this point, this “as far as humanly possible” turned out to be about 2 miles or so. I found a spot (still in the restricted area) and pitched my tent — there was no way I’d cross this canyon today. I fell asleep almost immediately.</p>\n<p>By this time, I had exactly two sips of water left and 2 miles to hike up and down to the next water source. I was in trouble.</p>\n<p><img __ASTRO_IMAGE_=\"{&#x22;src&#x22;:&#x22;assets/blog/posts/loowit-trail/c121405b6e82577acc01dcefadbebc85cce4938c-1093x718.jpg&#x22;,&#x22;alt&#x22;:&#x22;Illegal camping in the Restricted zone. I&#x27;m sorry :(&#x22;,&#x22;index&#x22;:0}\"></p>\n<h2 id=\"day-four\">Day four</h2>\n<p>This was one of those days when you think: “Ok, how can I quit this now?” And the answer is, basically, you can’t. At this point, there’s no exit from the trail that would take you to people faster. There’s no way around the upcoming Toutle Drop (I’ll get to it in a minute). There’s no quitting, only pushing ahead and hoping you can make it, which at this point was not a sure thing.</p>\n<p>I had my sip of water for breakfast and hit the trail. Since I haven’t eaten much and started to get fairly dehydrated, I got to the point of being slightly delirious. I had to take breaks every few hundred yards — taking my pack off, spreading my sleeping pad, and just laying down for a few minutes. The next 2 miles were the longest two miles in my life.</p>\n<p>Luckily, I met another hiker, who was generous enough to share half a bottle of water with me. I’ve taken a picture of him on his phone in return, and was incredibly grateful for the water and some tips on what awaits me ahead.</p>\n<p>Ahead was the Toutle Drop. I don’t think it’s an official name of this feature, but every hiker I’ve met referred to it like this.</p>\n<p><img __ASTRO_IMAGE_=\"{&#x22;src&#x22;:&#x22;assets/blog/posts/loowit-trail/fc7a46e9765305362cfbb19753635db862f77d37-1131x695.jpg&#x22;,&#x22;alt&#x22;:&#x22;Toutle River down below&#x22;,&#x22;index&#x22;:0}\"></p>\n<p>Right there, at the very bottom of this by far the deepest canyon on the trail, there is a tiny stream. It’s Toutle River, and in fact, it’s not so tiny, it’s just very far below.</p>\n<p>The Drop is a sharp descent over a slope of the canyon. You go down on loose pomace and volcanic ash. One sloppy or unsteady step, and you will lose your footing and tumble hundreds of feet down to the bottom of the canyon.</p>\n<p><img __ASTRO_IMAGE_=\"{&#x22;src&#x22;:&#x22;assets/blog/posts/loowit-trail/403784db89e8a7147ae4c72fff34bb1918717ea4-1600x1272.jpg&#x22;,&#x22;alt&#x22;:&#x22;Map&#x22;,&#x22;index&#x22;:0}\"></p>\n<p>By the time I got to the final ~30 feet rope-climb down to the river, I was set on spending the rest of my day right there, by the water. All the water I can drink! Flowing, roaring, splashing! Sweet, sweet unlimited water!</p>\n<p><img __ASTRO_IMAGE_=\"{&#x22;src&#x22;:&#x22;assets/blog/posts/loowit-trail/59fef8b7e923e16c5616fbe834f711593fe78704-1024x768.jpg&#x22;,&#x22;alt&#x22;:&#x22;Toutle River&#x22;,&#x22;index&#x22;:0}\"></p>\n<p>I spent about 3 hours by the river. There was not a spot of shade, so I covered myself with my sleeping mat, and just laid there for hours, drifting asleep, hot and tired. Every now and again, I’d go and refill my water bottle, drink it all, doze off for a bit and repeat. I even ate half of one of my sweet food items: even if I can’t hold it and vomit it right away, at least I’d have enough water to recover quickly. It went fairly well, and provided some necessary calories and a slight energy boost.</p>\n<p><img __ASTRO_IMAGE_=\"{&#x22;src&#x22;:&#x22;assets/blog/posts/loowit-trail/26ff8575a440eafcaf803f037ace2aee6963e0df-768x1024.jpg&#x22;,&#x22;alt&#x22;:&#x22;Unlimited water!&#x22;,&#x22;index&#x22;:0}\"></p>\n<p>In front of me was a daunting uphill stretch of over 2000 ft of elevation. Also, there was an intersection where I could attempt to exit the trail: I could hike lower, take a trail that goes parallel to Loowit trail, and pop out at a road leading to the Climbers Bivouac. By my estimations, this path was about a mile longer but offered fewer elevation changes. The biggest downside was that the final mile or so was a roughly 1000 ft ascent, overall elevation gain would be approximately the same as at Loowit trail, and this other trail was unlikely to have any hiker traffic in case I pass out. At this stage of my hike, passing out became a real concern, and I had to keep it in mind.</p>\n<p><img __ASTRO_IMAGE_=\"{&#x22;src&#x22;:&#x22;assets/blog/posts/loowit-trail/5fd723d376224f8cbc98375087c74f959b08aaa0-1024x768.jpg&#x22;,&#x22;alt&#x22;:&#x22;Toutle River&#x22;,&#x22;index&#x22;:0}\"></p>\n<p>I refilled my water containers for the last time: there will be no water for the next 8+ miles. Basically, there will be no water all the way to the trailhead parking. Or so I thought. I took another nap at the campground just above the river, and made an executive decision to attempt to exit the trail by taking this other trail I described above. There will still be a chance to return back to the Loowit trail later without losing anything.</p>\n<p>I hiked for a couple of miles through the forest and set up camp right over a river beside a sturdy bridge over Sheep Canyon. It was a relief to find more water: it meant that I could have all the water I want for breakfast and refill once more before the final push to the parking lot. I was very much set on finishing tomorrow, no matter what.</p>\n<h2 id=\"day-five\">Day five</h2>\n<p>I woke up early and was in a good mood. I was still weak, exhausted, and ached all over from sleeping on a deflated sleeping pad, but it was my last day on the trail. The plan was this: I hike to the trailhead, get into my car, drive to Vancouver, WA, eat Wendy’s Double Baconator and gulp a large diet Vanilla Ginger Ale, spend the night at a nice hotel, take a shower and do the laundry, and drive home the next morning.</p>\n<p>Motivation, unfortunately, is not enough for pushing through 8 miles of very challenging mountain terrain. I’ve barely eaten in 5 days, poorly hydrated, sore all over; the sun is mercilessly shining, deep canyons with rope climbing and another set of lava boulder fields lie ahead.</p>\n<p>Honestly, I remember very little about this day. I remember taking long breaks every few hundred yards. Just laying down for a few minutes (hours?), rationing water, and dreaming about Vanilla Ginger Ale.</p>\n<p>I set myself a miles countdown: 2 miles before the parking lot, I’d hit the approach trail — 2 miles of 100% downhill. So I subtracted these 2 miles from whatever milage I had left. Roughly speaking, I just needed to push through about 6 miles of the trail to get to this final trail intersection and then just descent to the parking lot.</p>\n<p><img __ASTRO_IMAGE_=\"{&#x22;src&#x22;:&#x22;assets/blog/posts/loowit-trail/dcd871d4d6b3a8391811546495025dc9891aadfb-1024x768.jpg&#x22;,&#x22;alt&#x22;:&#x22;View&#x22;,&#x22;index&#x22;:0}\"></p>\n<p>…Of course, I ran out of water about 3 miles before my target intersection.</p>\n<p>…At sunset, I met two hikers who shared some water with me, and strongly suggested I spend the night in a little patch of trees right ahead of me: attempting to cross another boulder field at night in my condition concerned them gravely, and I concurred. I crossed a patch of boulders, entered a tree patch, spotted a tiny opening besides the trail, and set there for the night. Words “Cowboy camping” popped into my clouded mind, and given that was pretty much unable to think straight or do much, I decided to give it a shot. Cowboy camping is, basically, camping without a tent. You just unroll your sleeping mat, lay down, and sleep under the stars. Not in a nice hotel after a double baconator as planned, but right there in the bushes, with one of my dry sacks as a pillow and with a buff covering my face and ears from insects.</p>\n<p>In all honesty, it wasn’t too bad. And the night sky was absolutely, incredibly covered with stars with Milky Way visible so clearly, I didn’t know it was even possible to see it like this. As for the insects — my biggest concern — aside from a few random ants crossing my legs a few times, no one bothered me.</p>\n<h2 id=\"finale\">Finale</h2>\n<p>Well, this Saturday <strong>had</strong> to be my last day. With just about 2-3 miles to the parking lot trail and 2 miles of downhill, I had to make it there today. I woke up at about 6 o’clock, and by then I knew what to expect. In a few minutes, runners will start passing by. About an hour or so later, I’ll meet the first hikers. In about 2 hours, I’ll meet the majority of people who started the trail today. By this time, all of it was clear and very predictable. I got up stuffed my dew-soaked quilt into the pack and started my final hike.</p>\n<p>I ran out of water pretty quickly. I didn’t have much to begin with, probably 4 or 5 sips, and the adventures of the week took their toll — I <strong>had</strong> to drink. I met a few people in the next mile or so, mostly runners, and you don’t ask runners for water: they are on the clock, and they have smaller water reserves. I was lucky, again, to meet a fellow hiker who looked at me after I asked for a sip of water and just refilled my whole bottle. He explained that he’s been in a similar situation more than once, and it was time for him to pay it forward. I was so grateful! A full bottle of water! I drank half of it within minutes :)</p>\n<p>Crossing the last boulder field, dried out Swift creek, and — finally — here’s the intersection with a trail going downhill to the parking lot! I made it!</p>\n<p>About an hour later, I put my backpack in the trunk of my car and left Climbers Bivouac. Alive, hungry, dehydrated, sore, and aching all over, dirty but happy that I made it.</p>\n<h2 id=\"lessons-learned\">Lessons Learned</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Dehydrated food is nice, but it’s useless without water. The same goes for sweet food. Also, always test any new trail food before taking it with you. There’s a chance you are not compatible with it.</li>\n<li>Fewer <em>moving parts</em> next time: no inflatable sleeping pad — no problem. No stove, no problem. You get the idea.</li>\n<li>Water planning and management are key. Especially if you drink a lot. Consider trails with water readily available instead of hiking trails known for their long dry stretches.</li>\n<li>Cowboy camping is ok. Not a fan, but it’s totally an option in an open space. Wouldn’t do it in a forest, though.</li>\n<li>If you’re set on a trail that you think maybe more challenging than what you can handle, consider your exit strategy. More than once I thought about exiting the trail. And every time I convinced myself that I shouldn’t. If I had a clear strategy of when, where, why, and how I could exit, I’d probably cut the trip short but also wouldn’t suffer as much :)</li>\n<li>Have your location beacon ready. More than once I was this close to pushing the SOS button and just giving up. I passed out a few times and had difficulty standing up, and thought that this is it, an SOS situation. Ironically, it gave me a sense of confidence: well, I can always call for help, so let me just try and push a bit further, and if I absolutely cannot move anymore, I’ll do the SOS thing. I never did, of course, but this option was very much on the table.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"now-what\">Now what?</h2>\n<p>For about 3 days after I got back home, I was recovering from severe dehydration and also eating like crazy. I bought a watermelon, a bunch of grapes, and a ton of other juicy fruit. I drank a lot, and it’s hard to appreciate tap water enough until you have no access to water for days. All things considered, I recovered fairly quickly. But I still haven’t unpacked my backpack.</p>\n<p>For about a week after my return home, I was absolutely, 100% done with backpacking forever. Never again will I voluntarily subject myself to this kind of experience! <strong>NEVER!</strong></p>\n<p>About 2 weeks later, as I finishing this story, I’m thinking about where can I go next? What short, 1-2-night hike is easy enough yet interesting and exciting? And as of the time of this writing, I’ve got a few ideas ;) But to be completely honest, my 2020 backpacking season is probably over. I’m likely to take a few day hikes, an overnight maybe, but that’s about it. Next year, I’ll do this whole Loowit trail again, clockwise this time, earlier in the year when the water is abundant and all creeks are still flowing. With this experience, it’s going to be a breeze and walk in a park! Right? RIGHT?!</p>",{headings:908,imagePaths:943,frontmatter:944},[909,912,915,918,921,924,927,930,933,936,939,940],{depth:196,slug:910,text:911},"mt-loowit-st-helens","Mt.

Year after year, I try different tech stacks, design approaches and platforms, and this time around I decided to do something differently.\n\n## Why Rebuild\n\nMy primary goal is to learn new tech and build a nice site. Over the years, I've collected an endless list of things I want to implement on my personal site, but for the longest time I tried to find an existing product I can use and that meets my requirements.\n\nUnfortunately, building on top of my existing blog is not really viable (or flexible enough). At this moment, my main site runs on Ghost hosted on [Digital Ocean](https://m.do.co/c/4c9e726c78a9). Even though Ghost has a nice CMS interface and somewhat works with static frontends, It's not flexible enough for what I want to do. As a result, I'm doing a full rebuild, from scratch.\n\n## Why Share\n\nLast year I tried live coding on Twitch, and it worked out pretty well. I got some viewers and even subscribers, but more importantly I worked out my imposter paralysis. Sharing my coding sessions live with an unknown group of people made me realize that I know enough to share my knowledge and make it helpful for others. It's also fun, I must add ;)\n\nThis time, with a throve of new experience and new knowledge I want to share more and more regularly. I will build individual components, design and re-design the site, and poke around many things I know literally nothing about at this moment. Fun, right?!\n\n## The Plan\n\nIt's fair to day that I don't have a solid plan to follow. I do track some of the ideas in [GitHub](https://github.com/rosnovsky/sanity-gatsby-blog/projects/1), but it's very much work in progress. But generally the plan is to start with what I've built so far and proceed until I'm happy with the results. I don't think it's the kind of work that has an end, but I'm going to build and improve a bunch of things, from look and feel to personl library and CMS plugins along the way; we'll add comments to blog posts, contact forms, and a bunch of serverless functions. I plan to livestream whenever I can with the goal of streaming whenever I work on this project.\n\n## Progress\n\nSo far I've bootstrapped a [Gatsby](https://gatsbyjs.com) website with [Sanity](https://sanity.io) as a CMS hosted on [Netlify](https://netlify.com). Santy actually warrants a whole separate blog post: I really dig it and enjoy it enough to build a [plugin](https://github.com/rosnovsky/sanity-plugin-autocomplete-tags) :) I use [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com) for styling, [Auth0](https://auth0.com) for identity and user management, and will be using [Mux](https://mux.com) for livestreaming on the website and [Stripe](https://stripe.com) for subscriptions and such. Quite a few things to learn and implement!\n\n## Next Steps\n\nSubscribe to my [Twitch](https://twitch.com/rosnovsky) or [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCApabnhvILEGN5EQjdhy1gA) and check back every now and again. Submit your bug report to Github, add your ideas to the project.

I do track some of the ideas in <a href=\"https://github.com/rosnovsky/sanity-gatsby-blog/projects/1\">GitHub</a>, but it’s very much work in progress. But generally the plan is to start with what I’ve built so far and proceed until I’m happy with the results. I don’t think it’s the kind of work that has an end, but I’m going to build and improve a bunch of things, from look and feel to personl library and CMS plugins along the way; we’ll add comments to blog posts, contact forms, and a bunch of serverless functions. I plan to livestream whenever I can with the goal of streaming whenever I work on this project.</p>\n<h2 id=\"progress\">Progress</h2>\n<p>So far I’ve bootstrapped a <a href=\"https://gatsbyjs.com\">Gatsby</a> website with <a href=\"https://sanity.io\">Sanity</a> as a CMS hosted on <a href=\"https://netlify.com\">Netlify</a>. Santy actually warrants a whole separate blog post: I really dig it and enjoy it enough to build a <a href=\"https://github.com/rosnovsky/sanity-plugin-autocomplete-tags\">plugin</a> :) I use <a href=\"https://tailwindcss.com\">Tailwind</a> for styling, <a href=\"https://auth0.com\">Auth0</a> for identity and user management, and will be using <a href=\"https://mux.com\">Mux</a> for livestreaming on the website and <a href=\"https://stripe.com\">Stripe</a> for subscriptions and such.

Not because it’s difficult to use but because I haven’t had a good use case for it before. These days as a Developer Support Engineer, I type a lot, and a lot of the stuff I type is quite repetitive. Since I started using TextExpander, it saved me about 5 hours of typing things that I would type anyway. It’s quite simple: when you type a snippet, say, `zauth0` or `zfig`, TextExpander turns these tiny words into phrases and sentences (`zauth0` turns into my full signature, with email, title and such, and `zfig` turns into “Let’s figure it out.” When you type something a lot, TextExpander would create a new snippet for you and remind you to use every now and again until you incorporate it into your typing.

Yet in the true spirit of native Mac applications, it’s not bloated with obscure features, bells, and whistles. It’s clean, beautiful, and, powerful — exactly the way we like our day-to-day tools to be.\n\nAvailable in [Setapp](https://go.setapp.com/invite/wccvxzmm).\n\n## CleanShotX\n\n![CleanShotX](assets/blog/posts/5-tools-in-5-minutes/d7a040069784967a81342fc06098324c8a591680-3269x2569.png)\n\nThere are dozens if not hundreds of apps one could use to take and share screenshots. Hell, you could take screenshots with a simple shortcut built into macOS, no applications needed! Yet with CleanShotX, you could take a screenshot or make a screencast using the same system-wide shortcuts you’d normally use, edit the image (highlight something, blur private information, add a text comment, arrows, you name it), and share it with just another click (or a ⌘-v).

Again, there are a bunch of similar apps and a bunch of apps that have similar features (think Alfred or Quicksilver), but Paste made it really natural for me to never think about my copy-paste buffer ever again. If I ever copied something — anything — an image, a secret, and app id, whatever it is, I’ll be able to find it and paste it again with a natural keyboard shortcut. Paste makes it easy to search whatever you copied in the past and even create collections of frequently pasted things.

Dead relatives, friends, and acquaintances, sick loved ones, ruined lives, and futures altered forever. In whatever scheme of things you look at 2020, it was abysmally horrible. Yet humans do human things: we adapt, regroup, process, and move on. And we have hope. Hope that 2021 will be better. That we will persevere, and come out of this whole mess stronger and more resilient, individually and as species. Today, though, I want to take a moment and take a look back at _my_ 2020.\n\nAll in all, it was not too terrible, albeit terrible nonetheless.\n\n![Four](assets/blog/posts/2020-you-won-t-be-missed/9da9642a3a1fee12424433a53ece77cdab8379d4-960x952.jpg)\n\nIt was my first full year at Auth0 — I joined the company in December 2019 and started really contributing in 2020. I enjoyed commuting to our office in Bellevue and hang out with my colleagues. I've been learning, in scientific terms, a _shitload_ of stuff, and it was so very cool. And overall, I got so much better at everything I do!\n\nIn late February, my son Vlad had terrible viral bronchitis, which I'm almost certain was in fact COVID. Both my wife and I got mildly sick afterward, and since COVID testing and reliable information were non-existent, we'll never know for sure. In early March, Vlad's school had a case and was shut down. It hasn't reopened since.\n\n![March](assets/blog/posts/2020-you-won-t-be-missed/ead449b167563c6476f87a9424cc6775f1bd7ed4-1024x989.jpg)\n\n![Clock](assets/blog/posts/2020-you-won-t-be-missed/f1376ac828aaa1294f28d4aa5064de12e29694ca-744x958.jpg)\n\nAuth0 offices closed in mid-March and there's no concrete plan to reopen them soon. They are ready for us to come back when it's safe: the Bellevue team outfitted it with all possible safety measures. I'm not coming back until everyone in my household gets a vaccine; most people I know are in the same boat. Our company offsite in Mexico was canceled, what a bummer.\n\n![Auth0](assets/blog/posts/2020-you-won-t-be-missed/39c9fbdd98e14dad1f6c328b4ff137d1f4748b9e-3662x2744.jpg)\n\n![Last in-person All-Hands](assets/blog/posts/2020-you-won-t-be-missed/573ecdb8ccc8e069379345d7a3ecf0ef5b81cd60-10814x3688.jpg)\n\n![OOF2020 Canceled](assets/blog/posts/2020-you-won-t-be-missed/3b30a8c7ab1e667ed590a65db7830b73ecf5aa03-4032x3024.jpg)\n\nIt's safe to say that because of where I work, I'm much, much better off than many. I can work from home and Auth0 paid for my home office equipment. I can take as much time off work as I need, at any moment, no questions asked (especially, if it's related to COVID). And for this I'm grateful.\n\nIn March I finished my second tattoo. It's a Phoenix, a mythical bird that rises from the ashes over and over. This tattoo reminds me of all the difficulties I'd overcome over the years and that no matter what happens next, I will pull through.\n\n![Step One](assets/blog/posts/2020-you-won-t-be-missed/5a071292e7b7416812ef1646dc07e153e4793dd8-3910x1746.jpg)\n\n![Step Two](assets/blog/posts/2020-you-won-t-be-missed/f1815b51389c8fd0ea90451b142a18d2e19baec7-3024x4032.jpg)\n\n![Final](assets/blog/posts/2020-you-won-t-be-missed/419e8b815b0024e4e5e79a3de390121e43c32f74-2744x3662.jpg)\n\nI hiked a lot this summer. I even hiked around Mt. Loowit (St. Helens) and returned home in one piece. I also met a black bear in the wild and lived to tell the story.\n\n![Bear](assets/blog/posts/2020-you-won-t-be-missed/70b5be5b2386e5dff640d92850cd17be6bd072c8-1122x1150.jpg)\n\nNever in my life was I as productive as in 2020.

And it all paid off already or will pay off in immediate future.\n\nThis last bit made possible in part thanks to my psychiatrist: this year I was diagnosed with ADHD and bipolar depression and got proper treatment.

Dead relatives, friends, and acquaintances, sick loved ones, ruined lives, and futures altered forever. In whatever scheme of things you look at 2020, it was abysmally horrible. Yet humans do human things: we adapt, regroup, process, and move on. And we have hope. Hope that 2021 will be better. That we will persevere, and come out of this whole mess stronger and more resilient, individually and as species. Today, though, I want to take a moment and take a look back at <em>my</em> 2020.</p>\n<p>All in all, it was not too terrible, albeit terrible nonetheless.</p>\n<p><img __ASTRO_IMAGE_=\"{&#x22;src&#x22;:&#x22;assets/blog/posts/2020-you-won-t-be-missed/9da9642a3a1fee12424433a53ece77cdab8379d4-960x952.jpg&#x22;,&#x22;alt&#x22;:&#x22;Four&#x22;,&#x22;index&#x22;:0}\"></p>\n<p>It was my first full year at Auth0 — I joined the company in December 2019 and started really contributing in 2020. I enjoyed commuting to our office in Bellevue and hang out with my colleagues. I’ve been learning, in scientific terms, a <em>shitload</em> of stuff, and it was so very cool. And overall, I got so much better at everything I do!</p>\n<p>In late February, my son Vlad had terrible viral bronchitis, which I’m almost certain was in fact COVID. Both my wife and I got mildly sick afterward, and since COVID testing and reliable information were non-existent, we’ll never know for sure. In early March, Vlad’s school had a case and was shut down. It hasn’t reopened since.</p>\n<p><img __ASTRO_IMAGE_=\"{&#x22;src&#x22;:&#x22;assets/blog/posts/2020-you-won-t-be-missed/ead449b167563c6476f87a9424cc6775f1bd7ed4-1024x989.jpg&#x22;,&#x22;alt&#x22;:&#x22;March&#x22;,&#x22;index&#x22;:0}\"></p>\n<p><img __ASTRO_IMAGE_=\"{&#x22;src&#x22;:&#x22;assets/blog/posts/2020-you-won-t-be-missed/f1376ac828aaa1294f28d4aa5064de12e29694ca-744x958.jpg&#x22;,&#x22;alt&#x22;:&#x22;Clock&#x22;,&#x22;index&#x22;:0}\"></p>\n<p>Auth0 offices closed in mid-March and there’s no concrete plan to reopen them soon. They are ready for us to come back when it’s safe: the Bellevue team outfitted it with all possible safety measures. I’m not coming back until everyone in my household gets a vaccine; most people I know are in the same boat.

I can work from home and Auth0 paid for my home office equipment. I can take as much time off work as I need, at any moment, no questions asked (especially, if it’s related to COVID). And for this I’m grateful.</p>\n<p>In March I finished my second tattoo. It’s a Phoenix, a mythical bird that rises from the ashes over and over.

I just want to write this down since this was one of my first encounters with this natural phenomenon.

Just to make it clear: it’s a very, very stable, very thick, and super solid tectonic plate. And when you’re in the middle of it, there’s no possibility of an earthquake happening, practically ever. You get some tremors from distant earthquakes every now and then, but they are in the imperceptible range of magnitude 1-2.\n\nAfter moving to Pacific Northwest in 2013, earthquakes suddenly became a real possibility. For the first five years in Cascades foothills along the Columbia River gorge, I was closely following seismic activities around us. With Mt. St. Helens visible from almost everywhere in Vancouver, WA, and Mt. Hood looming practically wherever you are, volcanos, eruptions, and earthquakes were always on my radar. I’d read about swarm quakes around one of the nearby volcanoes, or somewhere along the coast. Then I’d read that we had an earthquake last night somewhere real close (as in 20-30 miles), but it was, say, magnitude 2.5.\n\nYears passed, and earthquakes were replaced **on my radar** by more pressing issues (work, family, school, and such). We moved north to the Seattle area, and since mountains here are somewhat further away from our house than they were in Vancouver, and since the closest volcano, Mt. Rainier, is pretty far away, it all kinda faded away. I mean, I understand that nothing changed really; if anything, we are in a more tremor-prone are now with Juan de Fuca plate, and multiple faults right underneath our house, but it all somehow got less real, I guess…\n\nAnd then you wake up at 2:51 am on a Friday night because your bed is shaking pretty violently, and the whole house is rattling and creaking for a whole 5-10 seconds.\n\nApparently, this is the third strongest earthquake in Washington in the last 10 years, two others being M4.9 in Poulsbo in 2009, and M4.7 near Okanagan in 2011. This one hit only 7 miles from home, in Monroe (I’m in Mill Creek), about 1 hour northeast of Seattle.\n\nAt first, I thought a truck hit our house. We have a pretty quiet straight street passing by the house, and at night people do not really obey the 35 mph speed limit. They speed by, and at least on two occasions in the past 2 years, these racers hit parked cars on the street. So, my first assumption when my house started shaking and making noises at night - someone hit the house with their car!\n\nBut then it went all quiet. Wife woke up, looked at the time on her phone, and went back to sleep (she later admitted that she didn’t understand why she randomly woke up in the middle of the night, and angrily went back to sleep as in like, what the hell, why am I awake?!). Neighbors across the yard turned their patio lights, all was quiet, but felt off. A few minutes later, another shake, much shorter (like, maybe a 2-3 seconds), but as noticeable. By this time, I realized what’s going on, got up, met our completely freaked out cats just outside our bedroom, checked on my son (he didn’t wake up), and checked Twitter.\n\nI never felt an earthquake before (at least, I can’t remember it), and this was a jolt of an experience. We don’t have any food or water for emergencies! I have no idea what to do in an earthquake (run? go outside? crawl under the bed??). So I spent the rest of the night reading through all the news about all the local earthquakes, preparedness blogs, and so on.

You can’t really drive and watch [Kurzgesagt](https://www.youtube.com/user/Kurzgesagt), but you can drive and listen to [Science Vs](https://gimletmedia.com/shows/science-vs).\n\nHere’s a list of my favorite podcasts. Some of them are in their second decade of running, some are pretty new, but all of them are a tremendous source of knowledge, news, and human experience as it relates to hitech industry in general, and software development in particular. Feel free to make a [pull request](https://github.com/rosnovsky/rosnovsky.us/edit/main/posts/blog/tech-podcasts-in-2019.mdx) if you think I’ve missed a great show here!\n\n**TL;DR**: **You can** **[download a complete OPML list of all 30 shows](https://s3.us-west-1.wasabisys.com/rosnovsky-media/overcast.opml)** **mentioned below. Just feed it to your favorite podcast app (I suggest** **[Overcast](https://overcast.fm/)) and have all these shows in you subscriptions right away!**\n\n## **Dev**\n\nDev podcasts provide a great deal of information and an amazing learning experience. They also give a greater sense of community and feeling of belonging. Below is a list of podcasts that deal directly with software and web development.\n\n### **1.** [**Syntax**](https://syntax.fm/)​\n\nRelatively new and a real hit. Two hosts, Wes “Barracuda” Bos & Scott “El Toro Loco” Tolinski, normally make JavaScript courses and speak at conferences, but every now and then (more like a few times a week) they get together and talk shop. From general things like how do you advance as a freelancer or get your first dev job to the newest CSS tricks and **sick** latest internalization features. “Potluck” Q&A episodes and pinpoint “Tasty Treats”.\n\nSyntax [iTunes](https://itunes.apple.com/ca/podcast/syntax-tasty-web-development-treats/id1253186678?mt=2) | Syntax [RSS](http://feed.syntax.fm/rss)​\n\n### **2.** [**React Podcast**](https://reactpodcast.simplecast.fm/)​\n\nIt’s all in the name. From interviews with core React team members to vision and in-depth specifics of the framework we all love (and [we do love it](https://2018.stateofjs.com/front-end-frameworks/overview/)!) to career discussions.\n\nReact Podcast [iTunes](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-react-podcast/id1341969432) | React Podcast [RSS](https://rss.simplecast.com/podcasts/6265/rss)​\n\n### **3.** [**Software Engineering Daily**](https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/)​\n\nA broad look on basically all things software dev. This one is not specific to web development, though. To be honest, I don’t have **that** much time, and I do have a lot of other good podcasts to listen to, so personally, I skim shownotes of new episodes and listen to those that look promising. Interesting topics come up more often then not, but time is a finite resource, unfortunately.\n\nSoftware Engineering Daily [iTunes](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/software-engineering-daily/id1019576853?ls=1&mt=2) | Software Engineering Daily [RSS](https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/category/podcast/feed)​\n\n### **4.** [**The Changelog**](https://changelog.com/podcast)​\n\nThe Changelog has been around for quite some time now. Episodes feature prominent engineers, developers, and other experts, and usually have a specific topic.\n\nThe Changelog [iTunes](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/the-changelog/id341623264) | The Changelog [RSS](https://changelog.com/podcast/feed)​\n\n### **5.** [**JS Party**](https://changelog.com/jsparty)​\n\n🎉🎉🎉 Fun and casual, the kind of chat you’d like to be a part of. As serious as some topics are (burnout, anyone?), episodes are mostly on inspiring and empowering side.\n\nJS Party [iTunes](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/js-party/id1209616598) | JS Party [RSS](https://changelog.com/jsparty/feed)​\n\n### **6.** [**Developer Tea**](https://spec.fm/podcasts/developer-tea)​\n\nDeveloper Tea is on a shorter, bite-size side of podcasting. Inspiring and useful to both newbies and seasoned developers, and available to anyone with a 20+ minute commute. I even trained my Alexa to give me new Developer Tea in the morning, and most days their episodes fit nicely into my breakfast routine.\n\nDeveloper Tea [iTunes](https://geo.itunes.apple.com/ca/podcast/feed/id955596067) | Developer Tea [RSS](https://feeds.feedburner.com/developertea)​\n\n### **7.** [**Full Stack Radio**](http://www.fullstackradio.com/)​\n\nWeekly in-depth interview show with Adam Wathan. Sometimes I listen to the guests and wonder if I’d ever have such an enormous understanding of tech as they do.\n\nFull Stack Radio [iTunes](https://geo.itunes.apple.com/ca/podcast/feed/id955596067) | Full Stack Radio [RSS](https://rss.simplecast.com/podcasts/279/rss)​\n\n### **8.** [**Shop Talk**](https://shoptalkshow.com/)​\n\nAnother great show about frontend development, web design and all things UX. It’s interesting how sometimes you here the same guests on different podcasts from this list, but every host and every show has a different angle and offers a different conversation. Exciting guests, great in-depth conversations.\n\nShop Talk [iTunes](https://itunes.apple.com/podcast/id493890455) | Shop Talk [RSS](https://shoptalkshow.com/feed/podcast)​\n\n### **9.** [**FreeCodeCamp**](https://freecodecamp.libsyn.com/)​\n\nFreeCodeCamp is one of the absolutely best and completely free and open-source resources for learning software development. It’s been growing like crazy, has incredible community of passionate people who are happy to share their knowledge and help out the newbies. Their podcast is no exception: awesome guests, stimulating topics, success stories and so much more. Highly recommended!\n\nFreeCodeCamp [iTunes](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/the-freecodecamp-podcast/id1313660749?mt=2&ls=1) | FreeCodeCamp [RSS](http://podcast.freecodecamp.org/rss)​\n\n### **10.** [**Second Career Devs**](https://secondcareerdevs.com/)​\n\nKyle talks with people who became software engineers after they had a previous career in other fields. This one is particularly dear to me since I’ve been a journalist and a radio host in my **previous life**, and can very much relate as being a second career developer myself.\n\nSecond Career Devs [iTunes](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/second-career-devs/id1317467797) | Second Career Devs [RSS](https://feeds.soundcloud.com/users/soundcloud:users:332558027/sounds.rss)​\n\n### **11.** [**Maintainable**](https://maintainable.fm/)​\n\nLegacy code, technical debt, and how to maintain and advance older projects (personal or at work). This one is tailored more towards seasoned developers audience, but anyone could benefit regardless of current experience level.\n\nMaintainable [iTunes](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/maintainable/id1459893010) | Maintainable [RSS](https://feeds.simplecast.com/7y1CbAbN)​\n\n### **12.** [**CodePen Radio**](https://blog.codepen.io/radio/)​\n\nCodePen is an awesome tool to quickly prototype a feature, showcase some code, do an exercise or collaborate on a project. They run an insightful podcast about, well, running a web software business.\n\nCodePen Radio [iTunes](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/codepen-radio/id824437159) | CodePen Radio [RSS](https://blog.codepen.io/feed/podcast/)​\n\n### **13.** [**Coding Blocks**](https://www.codingblocks.net/)​\n\n**Podcast about computer programming and software development so you can learn on the go.**\n\nIndeed. Topics vary greatly, but you’ll find yourself diving deep into different programming concepts and learning a whole lot of new stuff every month.\n\nCoding Blocks [iTunes](https://podcasts.apple.com/podcast/coding-blocks-software-web/id769189585) | Coding Blocks [RSS](https://www.codingblocks.net/podcast-feed.xml)​\n\n## **General Tech Talk**\n\nMore on the general side, these podcasts cover tech news. Some of them go in-depth with philosophical implications of tech stories, some deal with particulars of working in tech.\n\n### **14.** [**This Week in Tech**](https://www.twit.tv/shows/this-week-in-tech)​\n\nLeo Laporte is a true legend and one of the pioneers of podcasting. His [TWiT](https://www.twit.tv/)network runs a whole bunch of shows, from Cyber Security to iOS to daily tech news. I consider This Week in Tech to be the weekly tech news podcast.\n\nP.S. I’ve met with Leo once a while back, it was fun :)\n\n![Me and Leo Laporte](assets/blog/posts/tech-podcasts-in-2019/48898b458c771b1c327d452d017b7912ab0e73d8-1179x667.jpg)\n\nThis Week in Tech [iTunes](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/this-week-in-tech-mp3/id73329404?uo=10) | This Week in Tech [RSS](http://feeds.twit.tv/twit.xml)​\n\n### **15.** [**Accidental Tech Podcast**](https://atp.fm/)​\n\nMarco Arment, Casey Liss, and John Siracusa, a trio of well-known software developers, writers and producers, run this very special show. It’s both sarcastic, and optimistic, and all-doom-and-gloom at times, but then it’s something else completely. It’s all over the place in the best sense possible. It is quite heavily Apple-leaning, since hosts been covering Apple or working with Apple stack for decades. Marco Arment, for instance, is the person responsible for [Overcast](https://overcast.fm/), without a doubt the best podcast app out there.\n\nAccidental [iTunes](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/accidental-tech-podcast/id617416468) | Accidental [RSS](http://atp.fm/episodes?format=rss)​\n\n### **16.** [**Indie Hackers**](https://www.indiehackers.com/podcast)​\n\nI couldn’t skip Indie Hackers, although this is probably one of the podcasts that I’m not entirely sure I like :) Sometimes it’s a lot of hype, and guests are this self-made kind of know-it-alls, but then they strike gold with a meaningful, inspiring, and overall great conversation with someone who’s humble because they **truly** know their stuff. Hit and miss, in short, but still worth a sub.\n\nIndie Hackers [iTunes](itms://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/indie-hackers-podcast-how/id1206165808) | Indie Hackers [RSS](https://feeds.backtracks.fm/indiehackers/indie-hackers-podcast/feed.xml)​\n\n## **Apple & Mac**\n\nAs we all know, Apple **invented** podcasts. To exactly no one’s surprise, Apple is heavily covered by dozens of different shows. The company is beloved by some, and despised by others, but I really don’t know a single person who’s completely indifferent towards Apple.\n\n### **17.** [**MacBreak Weekly**](https://www.twit.tv/shows/macbreak-weekly)​\n\nThis is the oldest Mac and Apple show in existence; I remember watching one of the first ever HD videos I’ve ever watched, like, 50 years ago or something, and this first video was one of the how-to episodes of MBW (I still remember the opening score along with the video, and how long it took to download, and how very jittery it was on my old computer). One of my all-time favorites.\n\nMacBreak Weekly [iTunes](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/macbreak-weekly-mp3/id179237749?uo=10) | MacBreak Weekly [RSS](http://feeds.twit.tv/mbw.xml)​\n\n### **18.** [**Upgrade**](https://www.relay.fm/upgrade)​\n\nCo-founder of Relay.fm network Myke Hurley and his legendary co-host Jason Snell, in a heavily Apple leaning show about tech. They tend to look at all the tech scene through **Apple glasses**, and they do a great job spinning Apple stuff.\n\nUpgrade [iTunes](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/upgrade/id918152703) | Upgrade [RSS](https://overcast.fm/itunes918152703/upgrade)​\n\n### **19.** [**Vector**](https://www.imore.com/vector)​\n\nRene Ritchie of iMore runs this (almost) daily (and sometimes twice-a-day) show about personal tech in general and Apple tech in particular. Rene is great at explaining things, and usually he gets to the bottom of whatever he’s talking about before actually talking about it.\n\nVector [iTunes](http://applepodcasts.com/vector) | Vector [RSS](https://vector.libsyn.com/rss)​\n\n### **20.** [**Connected**](https://www.relay.fm/connected)​\n\nA unique mix of perspectives and accents. Apple-focused, this show offers a great deal of commentary and opinions you might disagree with. Just saying :)\n\nConnected [iTunes](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/id909109652) | Connected [RSS](https://overcast.fm/itunes909109652/connected)​\n\n## **Google & Android**\n\nGoogleverse is of course a thing, and quite a few exciting things go on in this universe at any given moment.\n\n### **21.** [**This Week in Google**](https://www.twit.tv/shows/this-week-in-google)​\n\nThis actually is quite a show. It is called This Week in Google, but man, do they ever stick to the topic! I mean it as a compliment, really: tha show is broader then just Google news, and covers everything even remotely related to Google, or Google’s tech, or Google’s potential tech, or future of technology, or whatever is exciting today :)\n\nThis Week in Google [iTunes](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/this-week-in-google-mp3/id326120877?uo=10) | This Week in Google [RSS](http://feeds.twit.tv/twig.xml)​\n\n### **22.** [**Material Podcast**](https://www.relay.fm/material)​\n\nTwo people known for their other shows, Andy Ihnatko of MacBreak Weekly and Florence Ion of All About Android, joined forces to create Material Podcast. All things Android, with quite a bit of easygoing fire-side chatter and entertaining points of view.\n\nMaterial Podcast [iTunes](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/material/id1015422651) | Material Podcast [RSS](https://www.relay.fm/material/feed)​\n\n### **23.** [**All About Android**](https://www.twit.tv/shows/all-about-android)​\n\nAlong with Android Central’s podcast, this is probably the Android show for the Android faithful. When a bunch of people passionate about Android, get together and spill their frustrations and excitement and hopes and experiences, no matter what you think about Android, you’re in for a great show.\n\nAll About Android [iTunes](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/all-about-android-mp3/id429307630?uo=10) | All About Android [RSS](http://feeds.twit.tv/aaa.xml)​\n\n## **Microsoft & Windows**\n\nIn recent years, Microsoft shifted a lot from a consumer-focused operating system and office software powerhouse, to a consumer and enterprise cloud and services company (with amazing consumer devices division, I must add!) In my personal opinion, this incredible turn of events doesn’t get enough love and attention, but then again, data lakes and Azure Active Directory probably have a rather narrow audience. Nevertheless, a few shows do an excellent job covering all things Microsoft.\n\n### **24.** [**Windows Weekly**](https://www.twit.tv/shows/windows-weekly)​\n\nIf you’re looking for some friendly venom from people covering Microsoft professionally, look no further. Sometimes I wonder why all the sarcasm, but then hosts go in-depth explains what’s going on, why, since when, and what’s next.\n\nWindows Weekly [iTunes](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/windows-weekly-mp3/id197875368?uo=10) | Windows Weekly [RSS](http://feeds.twit.tv/ww.xml)​\n\n### **25.** [**This Week in Channel 9**](https://channel9.msdn.com/shows/This+Week+On+Channel+9/)​\n\nThis is a bit **meta**. My colleague Christina Warren basically sums up all things Channel 9, Microsoft’s outgoing stream of news, feature update talks, tech discussions, blog posts and so on. I also recommend [Channel 9](https://channel9.msdn.com/) in its entirety, but be ready, it’s a lot of great content.\n\nTWiC9 [iTunes](https://itunes.apple.com/gb/podcast/this-week-on-channel-9-mp4-channel-9/id360667463) | TWiC9 [RSS](https://channel9.msdn.com/Shows/This+Week+On+Channel+9/feed/mp3)​\n\n### **26.** [**Windows Central Podcast**](https://windowscentral.libsyn.com/)​\n\nAnother quality show around all things Windows and Microsoft. More on the consumer side, I’d say, but it doesn’t mean you don’t get a comprehensive, in-depth look inside what’s up and coming in Microsoft universe.\n\nWindows Central [iTunes](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/windows-central-podcast/id1120948170?at=10l3Vy&ct=UUwpUdUnU40700YYwYwo5uw4zdpo5zwgzloorzgc3bomnxw2) | Windows Central [RSS](https://windowscentral.libsyn.com/rss)​\n\n## **General**\n\nThis last category of shows is more on a general side of things, and not necessarily directly related to tech or software development. Still, these are excellent general interest shows.\n\n### **27.** [**Science Vs**](https://gimletmedia.com/shows/science-vs)​\n\nOne of the best popular science podcasts out there. I really wished it was more regular and I definitely would like to see more episodes more often. But honestly, I’m not sure one can produce more content of this quality without sacrificing depth of the research and all the things that come in before you even begin recording.\n\nScience Vs [iTunes](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/science-vs/id1051557000?mt=2&at=1000lSb9&ct=gimweb) | Science Vs [RSS](https://feeds.megaphone.fm/sciencevs)​\n\n### **28.** [**Liftoff**](https://www.relay.fm/liftoff)​\n\nFor all of us space fans and enthusiasts, this is **the** space show. Latest news, tech advancements, plans and the reality of the space age, all the things we love and enjoy, nicely packed and unraveled by people with deep passion for space.\n\nLiftoff [iTunes](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/liftoff/id1031275911) | Liftoff [RSS](https://www.relay.fm/liftoff/feed)​\n\n### **29.** [**Inside Intercom**](https://www.intercom.com/blog/podcasts/)​\n\nA little bit on a corporate side of things, but nevertheless informative in general for those following SaaS and tech industry. A lot of really huge names stopped by Intercom’s virtual studios to share their journey to success.\n\nInside Intercom [iTunes](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/inside-intercom-podcast/id996103731?mt=2) | Inside Intercom [RSS](https://rss.art19.com/inside-intercom)​\n\n### **30.** [**99% Invisible**](https://99percentinvisible.org/)​\n\nThis one is again a more on a general interest side of things. Still, it’s a lot of fun and inspiration, and thought-provoking conversations, neatly packed in a 30-60 minutes.\n\n99% invisible [iTunes](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/99-invisible/id394775318?at=10l9zE) | 99% invisible [RSS](http://feeds.99percentinvisible.org/99percentinvisible)​","src/content/blog/2019/06/10/tech-podcasts-in-2019.md",[1127,1128],"assets/blog/posts/tech-podcasts-in-2019/48898b458c771b1c327d452d017b7912ab0e73d8-1179x667.jpg","@assets/blog/posts/tech-podcasts-in-2019/48898b458c771b1c327d452d017b7912ab0e73d8-1179x667.jpg","75a8130d6be1a67a",{html:1131,metadata:1132},"<p>It’s hard to believe, but I’ve been listening to podcasts for almost 15 years, and been podcasting myself since April 2006.

It had 1.25 Ghz G3 processor, like, 256 Mb of RAM, and a 40 Gb HDD. At the moment, it was the most exciting device I’ve ever owned. Mac OS X was such a blow of fresh air after Windows XP! It was well-designed, friendly, relatively fast, quiet. It had all the apps I wanted to use, and since I’ve never been a gamer, lack of gaming titles didn’t bother me at all. I was in love with Apple. In the years since, I owned a bunch of Macbooks, a couple of iMacs, all kinds of iPhones, iPads, and a pair of Apple Watches. My family is a full Apple house.\n\nApple of 2005 is not the same company like Apple in 2019. I’m not going to get into everything that makes Apple of 2019 into a Microsoft of 2005, and it’s not fair to compare them one to one, still, I’m convinced that these two have way more in common these days then they are different. Anyway, I’m not here to start another holy war, I’m just documenting my journey.\n\n## Reasons\n\nI’ve been thinking about leaving the Apple ecosystem for a while now. Apple has been slow to innovate or even uphold any level of quality of their laptops. In late 2016 I bought the latest and presumably the greatest MacBook Pro with TouchBar, and I had never been so disappointed in any Apple product, and possibly, in any piece of technology in a very long while. TouchBar is an unusable gimmick that replaced perfectly good function keys. The butterfly keyboard is by far, the very worst keyboard I’ve ever seen or used in my entire life (not to mention that I had to replace it twice because it’s constantly breaking due to its poor design). The computer is slow as heck (my bad, I could only afford 8 gigs of RAM), holds the charge for like 2 hours of light web browsing, tops, only has these stupid USB-C ports, doesn’t have an SD-card reader, has a relatively meh screen by today standards, no graphic card to speak of, and doesn’t support touch. Its operating system and applications are stale at best, and the day when Apple prevents any non-Apple-App-Store software from running on their laptops is closer than you think. You can service literally zero components of a computer that you (presumably) own.\n\nNow that I’ve got it out of my system, let’s get to the real reason: **Apple is boring as hell**. I remember when they were at the forefront of things, now they are just a fashion brand of mediocre tech and status quo. All interesting things in the tech industry are happening elsewhere, and it’s been like this for a while now.\n\nI want an adventure. I want new stuff. I want the cutting edge. I want round pegs in the square holes. I want to be with the misfits, the crazy ones. With the ones who see things differently.\n\n## The Plan\n\nTo this day, I haven’t had any serious day-to-day experience with Linux. I use Windows 10 at work, and it’s a pretty ok system, but it’s not something I want to deal with in my personal life for a variety of reasons (from the fact that direction may and will change, and you have no input, to the fact that you get system “as is”, and it always be like that.)\n\nThe only alternative I know to Windows and Mac OS is Linux in all its flavors (don’t get me started saying that there’s also ChromeOS. Not only it’s Linux-based, it’s quite a joke, tbh). So my plan was simple: try some Linuxes (or is it **Linuxi?**), make sure they meet my needs, gradually transition my work to Linux, and finally migrate to some decent hardware as well. This is a sensible thing to do, a smooth and straightforward plan. So, yeah. I did none of this in this order. What I did, I outright bought a performance laptop, slapped Ubuntu on it, and haven’t opened my MacBook for a week. This is how real **crazy ones** explore new things, amirite?\n\n## The Process\n\nHere’s how it went. I’ve been reading about different branches of Linux, different flavors, desktop environments, and all things in between. I watch countless hours of Youtube reviews of different hardware, how it plays with different software, what works, what doesn’t, how things are done, what they look like, what gets the Linux people excited, and so forth. It actually took me down the rabbit hole of open-source software, decentralization, privacy, and other things, so much so that I’ve completely left mainstream social networks for Mastodon. But this is a whole [different story](/blog/digital-hygine) - a story of me suddenly realizing that I’ve been doing my digital hygiene and social media all wrong this whole time.\n\nAnywho. Selecting a distro is like whoa?! 😲 There're hundreds if not thousands of them, most of them are so much alike, but some are so very different. Some have an underlying philosophy that drives the whole thing, some just have a cuter set of icons and a friendlier setup guide.\n\nSo how do I choose? Should I try Debian? After all, it runs on my home server. Or maybe, Ubuntu? I’ve tried it a few times in the past, and it runs on all my Digital Ocean instances. Maybe, Arch? It’s so customizable, they said. Manjaro, the friendly Arch? Fedora? CentOS? Mint? KDE Neon? OpenSUSE?\n\nAnd what about desktop environments? They are, again, so alike, yet so different. GNOME looks ok, but KDE people tend to bash it a lot, and Plasma 5 indeed looks amazing. Perhaps, Cinnamon? Bungie? MATE? Maybe, Xfce? Pantheon? Deepin?\n\nAnd what about hardware? Do NVidia cards work with Linux or do they not? Or is it the integrated Intel stuff that doesn’t work (or does it work?) What about HiDPI screens? Touch? External audio interfaces?\n\nSo here’s what I learned. **Literally, none of this matters.** When you’re just starting out, just go with the largest community, most available information, and just start somewhere. As far as hardware goes, Linux is at the point where it doesn’t matter what hardware you have, it will almost certainly support it. Worst case scenario, you’d need to type a few things into a command line, and maybe reboot.\n\n## Status\n\nRight now, I’m on a top-notch Dell XPS 15, 32 Gb of RAM, 1 TB of fast SSD and an Ubuntu. It’s been fantastic so far. I enjoy tinkering with the system, tweaking every little thing to my liking, although arguably GNOME doesn’t bend as far as KDE does. I’ve installed all the apps I need, including Steam, and with NVidia card on (I can turn it on and off at will), games look fantastic on this incredible HiDPI OLED touchscreen. I do venture into other live distros that I store on an SD card (yep, I’ve got an SD card reader here! Screw you, Apple!) It’s been almost 5 hours since I’ve unplugged the charger; I’ve been coding a bit, watching videos, listening to music in the background (and switching between tracks with predictable function keys), and writing this post on this great keyboard. Battery holds at 40%, and I haven’t really done any serious optimizations yet (although I plan to; I want to see if I can make this baby run for 10 hours on a single charge while I’m doing some meaningful work.)\n\nAre there quirks? Oh, hell yes. For starters, I’ve got a really new Killer Wifi card here, and apparently, it hasn’t made its way into the kernel yet. So I had indeed struggled for a few minutes until I found a step-by-step (with 2 steps, really) tutorial on how to add this specific card driver to my system. It will, of course, be included in the fall system update. Aside from that, some weirdness is going on with some VS Code shortcuts (they are supposed to work, but they don’t, specifically `Shift+Alt+Up/Down`); email clients are trash (not that I use them anyway, but still), Firefox is surprisingly unstable (it crashes whenever another app tries to open a browser window) (**UPD**: **Mozilla has already fixed this along with other minor annoyances**.) There are tricky issues with .NET (it installs, runs, and builds just fine, but some weirdness is going on with serving server responses and SSL, not sure yet). Overall visual language in GNOME is outdated, even though I’d say it’s meh bordering with ok. As for the laptop itself, speakers are narrowly passable at best. Oh, and the fingerprint scanner doesn’t work, and on the first try, the external monitor didn’t connect right away (pending investigation). HiDPI screen is also quirky in that scaling is basically 100%, 200%, or 300%, and some apps get confused (although, I’ve already seen Nextcloud fix it before my eyes: 2 days ago it was confusing, now it’s all good). Notifications in GNOME are useless since you can’t really really read the third line (and if click as to expand, they just clear up). I bet I’ll think of something else before next weekend.\n\n## What’s next\n\nGlad you asked! Next, I’m staying here for as long as this laptop lasts. With these specs, this solid quality build, and this level of future-proofing and serviceability (oh yeah, I can replace the SSD with a bigger one eventually; memory is topped out, though, but the battery is replaceable and serviceable as well) it could last me for 10 years. Sure, it’s still very early, but I’m so very happy with this move, I can’t even. So, will see.\n\nAs a side note here, I’m researching GNOME themes. I mean, out of dozens and dozens that I’ve seen, literally, none are good. I’m on Arc-Darker now, and I can stand it, but I’m looking into building my own theme. I’ve heard they are CSS-based ;)","src/content/blog/2019/08/25/mac-to-linux.md",[35],"5da40366764a8b3f",{html:1260,metadata:1261},"<p>the In 2005, I bought my first Mac mini. It had 1.25 Ghz G3 processor, like, 256 Mb of RAM, and a 40 Gb HDD. At the moment, it was the most exciting device I’ve ever owned. Mac OS X was such a blow of fresh air after Windows XP! It was well-designed, friendly, relatively fast, quiet. It had all the apps I wanted to use, and since I’ve never been a gamer, lack of gaming titles didn’t bother me at all. I was in love with Apple. In the years since, I owned a bunch of Macbooks, a couple of iMacs, all kinds of iPhones, iPads, and a pair of Apple Watches. My family is a full Apple house.</p>\n<p>Apple of 2005 is not the same company like Apple in 2019. I’m not going to get into everything that makes Apple of 2019 into a Microsoft of 2005, and it’s not fair to compare them one to one, still, I’m convinced that these two have way more in common these days then they are different. Anyway, I’m not here to start another holy war, I’m just documenting my journey.</p>\n<h2 id=\"reasons\">Reasons</h2>\n<p>I’ve been thinking about leaving the Apple ecosystem for a while now. Apple has been slow to innovate or even uphold any level of quality of their laptops. In late 2016 I bought the latest and presumably the greatest MacBook Pro with TouchBar, and I had never been so disappointed in any Apple product, and possibly, in any piece of technology in a very long while. TouchBar is an unusable gimmick that replaced perfectly good function keys. The butterfly keyboard is by far, the very worst keyboard I’ve ever seen or used in my entire life (not to mention that I had to replace it twice because it’s constantly breaking due to its poor design). The computer is slow as heck (my bad, I could only afford 8 gigs of RAM), holds the charge for like 2 hours of light web browsing, tops, only has these stupid USB-C ports, doesn’t have an SD-card reader, has a relatively meh screen by today standards, no graphic card to speak of, and doesn’t support touch. Its operating system and applications are stale at best, and the day when Apple prevents any non-Apple-App-Store software from running on their laptops is closer than you think. You can service literally zero components of a computer that you (presumably) own.</p>\n<p>Now that I’ve got it out of my system, let’s get to the real reason: <strong>Apple is boring as hell</strong>. I remember when they were at the forefront of things, now they are just a fashion brand of mediocre tech and status quo. All interesting things in the tech industry are happening elsewhere, and it’s been like this for a while now.</p>\n<p>I want an adventure. I want new stuff. I want the cutting edge. I want round pegs in the square holes. I want to be with the misfits, the crazy ones. With the ones who see things differently.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-plan\">The Plan</h2>\n<p>To this day, I haven’t had any serious day-to-day experience with Linux. I use Windows 10 at work, and it’s a pretty ok system, but it’s not something I want to deal with in my personal life for a variety of reasons (from the fact that direction may and will change, and you have no input, to the fact that you get system “as is”, and it always be like that.)</p>\n<p>The only alternative I know to Windows and Mac OS is Linux in all its flavors (don’t get me started saying that there’s also ChromeOS.

The deeply underlying reasons are not important (let’s just say, it’s all a part of a bigger self-care and mental health regimen), so I’ll go with the more on the surface ones here.\n\n`<tin-hat>`\n\n## **Social Media**\n\nFor me, social media was a way to socialize since its inception. I’ve got my invite into LiveJournal in 2003 and have been on social media ever since. I’ve moved to Facebook, and to Twitter, and to Instagram, I tried new sites as they popped up into existence only to disappear forever just a few years later. After I left my country of birth, social media became a way to keep up with friends and family. It all changed over time into a feeding tube, a constant fire hose of text, images, status updates, new, and, sure, ads. Scandal after scandal, these companies were getting away with everything, from storing and leaking plain-text passwords to breaking a democracy. I got so fed up with this, that over a year ago I made my first attempt to quit ([announcement in Russian](/blog/rosnovsky-park-second-coming/)). I’ve made a few strategic mistakes, and my experiment didn’t stick for too long; I think, I was back on Facebook within 2 weeks. This time it’s different. This time, I’m truly ready, and I have all the things and attitudes I need to never look back.\n\n## **Life after mainstream social media**\n\nIt’s really a huge privilege to be able to just quit Facebook. For so many people around the world, Facebook **is** the internet, and quitting it is just not an option. For me, luckily, it’s very much an option. I’m missing out, of course, since everyone and their grandmother is on Facebook, sharing baby pictures and concert invites, but my wife keeps me in the loop of truly important things and you know what? I’m still available! You have to be deliberate as in explicitly share things with that you think I might be interested in. I know, it’s hard to believe, but that’s how things used to be: you have friends and you don’t just make radio announcements whenever you find something you want to share with them. You’d call, text, talk to them over a coffee, send them a post pigeon or roll in a clay plate. Whatever you do, you’re deliberate in your communications and relationships.\n\nAnd you know what? It appears to be a good filter (well, still not sure if it’s good or bad, but it’s **a filter**). I used to struggle with guilt over the fact that I’m not connecting with people enough; I don’t call or text my friends that much, but hey, phones work both ways. If I don’t call or text you and therefore we lose connection, you weren’t calling me either. So was it ever a meaningful thing to begin with?..\n\n## **Alternatives**\n\nIn the world of total Facebook dominance, it’s surprising that alternatives even exist. One of them, [Mastodon](https://www.joinmastodon.org/), I’ve heard about before. I even tried it a few years back, but never got ahold of it: what are all these instances, how do the interact, the hell is fediverse, how do you build your life here?… Well, re-discovering Mastodon was for me like discovering this whole new internet. Small, friendly, open, weird in so many ways, but so much aligned with my values. Apparently, open source is huge, people build free software just for the hell of it, and it’s so easy to join them! They discuss big ideas, and how **next year is going to be the year of Linux** :)) There’s a ton of Youtube channels, podcasts, news sites and magazines (!) in this space. Art and artists are really big, people are not trying to pretend to be someone else, and big brands haven’t noticed any of this yet. You’re not being tracked (not even a Google Analytics tracker!), there are no ads of any kind, you own all of your data, you can take it with you at any time, delete your account instantly, and erase any trace of you ever being on the server. One [dude](https://mastodon.social/@dansup) decided that Instagram needs an open source [alternative](https://pixelfed.org/), and he’s been building it for a year at astonishing pace and fantastic results. Oh, and it federates with the rest of ActivityPub instances. I will write a Mastodon explainer eventually, since I sooo dig it now.\n\n## **But what about this digital hygiene thing?**\n\nWhat about it? :) My mind is clearer, I’m not constantly scrolling through countless ads, I’m not anxious to click on a link since I know it won’t follow me for the rest of my online life (I also use Firefox with Facebook container enabled to prevent not only regular trackers, but to block Facebook specifically from tracking me around the web). I’m not reading the news other then what comes as Breaking News alerts from the Washington Post. I discovered so many incredible people and ideas, I’m so very excited about this newly discovered little internet! I’m not refreshing Twitter before going to sleep, and I don’t check my Instagram first thing in the morning (I deleted both apps from my phone long ago). I live a more mindful and meaningful life in so many ways, I’m not sure I know how to express it. It’s just so much easier to do all this when you’re **off the grid** of FB and such. And aside from it all, I’m learning a lot. About people, about their perspectives, about software, hacking, about all sorts of things. Am I missing out on some action happening on Facebook and Twitter and elsewhere? Sure. Do I care? Nope, not anymore.\n\n**Notes**\n\n**Per law, Facebook and other mainstream social media companies must do whatever they choose with whatever data they gather from you while you are in any way engaged with their services (unless you’re in Europe) to increase shareholders’ profits.

As soon as I shared the launch post, I discovered that many things were broken with social images, from errors in URL encoding to a wrong background image on each social image.\n\n![social image](assets/blog/posts/generating-blog-social-images/c05ee73d6a6f6f5ecb72a78795feaddf7cf4cd25-1200x675.png)\n\nAs you can see, the background here belongs to a different post, although this particular card doesn't have any other obvious issues. In any case, this is something I wanted these cards to actually look like.\n\n![social image](assets/blog/posts/generating-blog-social-images/2b82a53bffadd9fcf4bc5e7dd32d8c2fc61829e1-780x420.png)\n\nIt's not perfect, but here's what's going on this card:\n\n- There's a blurred cover image that belongs to this particular post in the background\n- A card with post info is overlayed on top of this background image\n- Correct category and post date\n- There's a short summary of what the post is about\n\nThere are different approaches one could take here, from passing parameters of an image directly to a service like Cloudinary to generating a screenshot. Without going into obscure details, here's how I made this happen.\n\n## Step One: Generate a card\n\nI created a page, that generates a webpage with all the data I pass to it: title, publication date, category, etc.\n\nHere's an example: [this link](https://rosnovsky.us/generateOgImage?title=This%20is%20where%20the%20title%20goes&category=Category%20goes%20here&date=Jan%2011,%202021&subtitle=This%20is%20where%20the%20post%20summary%20goes,%20explaining%20wht%20the%20post%20or%20page%20is%20about&coverImage=https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1584824486516-0555a07fc511?ixid=MXwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHw%3D&ixlib=rb-1.2.1&auto=format&fit=crop&w=2100&q=80) leads to the page that builds the social card.\n\nAll this is is an HTML page dynamically generated based on passed parameters. It's this basic but opens a ton of flexibility. This page is just one of my other pages on this website.\n\n```typescript\n<div className=\"m-0 flex w-full\">\n  <div\n    className=\"relative border-1 bg-transparent w-full border-red-900 p-6\"\n    style={{\n      backgroundImage: bgUrl,\n      backgroundRepeat: 'no-repat',\n      backgroundSize: 'cover',\n      backgroundBlendMode: 'overlay',\n    }}\n  >\n    <main className=\"flex-col p-5 bg-opacity-80 bg-white border-2 border-black\">\n      <h3 className=\"text-red-900 font-bold font-mono text-xl w-96\">\n        {category || 'No category'}\n      </h3>\n      <h1 className=\"text-6xl leading-tight font-black mt-7\">\n        {title || 'No Title'}\n      </h1>\n      <p className=\"prose prose-2xl mt-8 mb-10\">{subtitle}</p>\n      <div className=\"flex justify-between\">\n        <p className=\"prose prose-lg text-2xl text-red-900 font-semibold font-mono\">\n          {date || 'No date'}\n        </p>\n        <p className=\"font-mono text-2xl font-bold underline text-red-900 \">\n          rosnovsky.us\n        </p>\n      </div>\n    </main>\n  </div>\n</div>\n```\n\n## Step Two: Capture a screenshot\n\nNow we need to turn this page into an image. I use a serverless function to do this. This function accepts required parameters, passes them to the social card page, takes and returns a screenshot. There are different ways of doing this, and I opted for a headless Chrome. I've written a function that loads the page generated in the previous step and takes a screenshot of a viewport of the size I like (780x420 in my case). Again, without going into obscure details, here's what it looks like:\n\n```typescript\nconst takeScreenshot = async function (url) {\n  const browser = await chromium.puppeteer.launch({\n    executablePath: local\n      ? '/Applications/Google Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google Chrome'\n      : await chromium.executablePath,\n    args: chromium.args,\n    defaultViewport: chromium.defaultViewport,\n    headless: chromium.headless,\n  });\n  const page = await browser.newPage();\n  await page.setViewport({ height: 420, width: 780 });\n  await page.goto(url);\n  const buffer = await page.screenshot();\n  await browser.close();\n  return `data:image/png;base64,${buffer.toString('base64')}`;\n};\n```\n\nDepending on whether I'm developing or this runs in production, this function takes a URL to the card page, launches headless Chrome, takes a screenshot, and returns a base64-encoded image.\n\n## Step Three: upload image to Cloudinary (or anywhere, really)\n\nThis is the easiest and the most arbitrary step. I wanted to use Cloudinary in some way to learn more about it, and although here I only use it as image hosting, I was able to poke around it for a bit. Anyway, in this step, we take the image we got in the previous step and just upload it to Cloudinary:\n\n```typescript\nconst uploadImage = async function (title, buffer) {\n  const cloudinaryOptions = {\n    public_id: `social-images/${title}`,\n    unique_filename: false,\n  };\n  return await cloudinary.uploader\n    .upload(buffer, cloudinaryOptions)\n    .then((response) => response.url);\n};\n```\n\n## Step Four: return something\n\nAgain, there are different options here: you could return a permanent redirect with HTTP `308 Permanent Redirect` status, or just respond with an OK and move on. The difference is in the way you incorporate the resulting image URL into your HTML. Some might add the URL of the serverless function that captures and uploads a screenshot right inside of a `<meta>` tag: in this case, permanent redirect makes sense. As soon as someone requests the page, they will attempt to read the meta tag URL and receive the uploaded image URL in response, permanently. However, in my experiments, it looks like sometimes the serverless function runs for some time (3-5 seconds) and meta scrappers just default to not having any image instead of waiting for the image URL. What I'm doing is a bit different: I'm \"fetching\" this serverless function in `useEffect `of the post's page and \"hardcode\" the resulting URL in the meta tag (since I know upfront what the URL would be, it's easy to know beforehand what URL to use for every post — it always look like this: `https://.../social-images/{POST TITLE}.png`)\n\n**UPDATE: **Well, apparently, it's more performant to add the URL to the serverless function directly to the meta tag after all. Sorry about the confusion :)\n\n## Considerations\n\nThere are some checks and considerations in place. First, the function checks if the image already exists, and if so, it returns it's URL right away. Next, there are default values in place: in case the function doesn't receive a title or post date, it would use placeholders to still produce an image. Now, it takes up to 5 seconds for the image to be generated for the first time; if you attempt to share the post immediately after publishing without visiting it first, scrappers may not wait until the image is generated and use a default image or no image instead. These are some of the things to keep in mind and improve down the road.","src/content/blog/2021/01/03/generating-blog-social-images.md",[1322,1323,1324],"assets/blog/posts/generating-blog-social-images/c05ee73d6a6f6f5ecb72a78795feaddf7cf4cd25-1200x675.png","assets/blog/posts/generating-blog-social-images/2b82a53bffadd9fcf4bc5e7dd32d8c2fc61829e1-780x420.png","@assets/blog/posts/generating-blog-social-images/c05ee73d6a6f6f5ecb72a78795feaddf7cf4cd25-1200x675.png","1650d0806ed929bc",{html:1327,metadata:1328},"<p>I was planning to add social images to my posts for a long time, and when I launched this version of the website, I didn’t really put any effort into making this happen.

By late April, I had two offers: a web dev contract with AT&T (boring, questionable work environment, rather short, but quite lucrative pay) and Microsoft (a lot of creative freedom, challenging project, access to some of the smartest engineers in the world, almost certain extension, **ok-ish** pay). I went with Microsoft as it seemed to be a more interesting project even if it didn’t pay too well. I learned a ton, met many incredible people, got extended, learned some more, shipped, and delivered. By early October, I was back on the job market, and let me tell, I was quite salty. Year-end is in sight, I’ve got some great new experience under my belt, but no cigar: where’s my job upgrade, damn it?!\n\nSo I’ve designed my new job hunt very precisely. Here’s what I did differently:\n\n- I stopped sourcing positions from trash sites (ZipRecruiter, Indeed, Monster, and a pile of others). They are infested with third- and fourth-party recruiters, staffing and temp agencies, scammers, and other leeches of this kind.\n- I started tracking my activities very carefully, methodically recording where I sourced a position from, how and when I applied, what’s the status, what’s the interview stage, etc. I now have a list of companies I will never consider again: those who didn’t have the decency to send an automated rejection and just ghosted me.\n- I sourced my positions almost exclusively from [Glassdoor](https://glassdoor.com/) and LinkedIn (to a much lesser extent), and directly by [searching](https://duckduckgo.com/) for local tech companies with great reviews or great backstories (and [exceptional hiring practices](https://github.com/poteto/hiring-without-whiteboards))\n- I only applied to companies I truly wanted to work at. Not “if the pay is great”, not “well, if I can work from home three times a week”, none of this. Just “Yep, that’s my place, and these are my people, and we’ll figure out the rest”. I was fortunate to be in the position to spend a few months just looking for a perfect fit, and not taking any job just because I needed a job ASAP.\n- I spent 10+ hours most days crafting cover letters, tweaking my [resume](https://rosnovsky.us/resume), researching companies in-depth, applying, answering emails, setting up calls, taking phone interviews, going to onsite interviews, doing take-home assignments. It was intense, draining, but so much fun!\n- Not even once did I attempt to please the interviewer or guess and offer answers I knew they were looking for; I was 100% my authentic self and gave exactly zero fucks about the usual hiring dance. “Where do I see myself in 5 years, you ask? Hopefully, on a beach with a mojito. Next question.” It was so liberating and so rewarding. I even got to wear my “Task failed successfully” t-shirt to one of the interviews just because I felt like it (and ended up getting an offer from them)\n- Being relaxed, authentic, and confident in my decision to never compromise on anything important to me, gave me this incredibly powerful feeling of being in control of the process, and not at the mercy of the **job market**.\n\nIn the end, I applied to 2x fewer positions than in the spring round and got 2.5x more offers in the same time-frame, all of which were permanent, full-time positions at companies I’d be happy to work for.\n\nI ended up with 5 offers, 4 of which were within my range (and the 5th one could probably be negotiated to get within the range), with a variety of benefit options, different flexibility levels, and a variety of career paths.\n\n![Proud](assets/blog/posts/new-job/092a5b24db6a734b563f88949dfc17daa0c2eddd-498x278.jpg)\n\nNow, with 4 offers in hand (and one coming in later), I had a tough task of making the right choice. Do I go for more money but less flexibility? Or a better work environment, but an unclear career path? Stock options or flexible paid time off? Well, I was set to not compromise on anything important, so… Flexible schedule, flexible (as in “unlimited”) paid time off, good 401(k) match, stock options, clear career path, challenging tasks, awesome team. All or nothing. And at this point, it was pretty easy to choose. Introducing [Auth0](https://auth0.com/).\n\n## **Process**\n\nThe interview process took about 5 weeks from the day I applied to accept the offer. It consisted of an initial phone screen, an interview with my potential manager, another one with my potential teammates, a take-home assignment, and finally a call with one of the senior directors. There’s a great post about how **exactly** Auth0 hires engineers.\n\n[How We Hire Engineers](https://auth0.com/blog/how-we-hire-engineers/)\n\nThe initial screen was nothing surprising, except for a sense of transparency and genuine interest in my experience and personality.\n\nSecond call… I blew it, big time :) It was set up as a Zoom meeting, and for some reason, I thought that I should expect a call, while in fact, I was supposed to call in myself. Anyway, the call was rescheduled and went well over an hour, and generally was just a friendly chat about me, my experience, job expectations, the company, position, team, management, and such. It went well, and the next step was set up.\n\nThe next call went equally well, and it was a great chance to get a better feel of the teammates, what they do, and who they are. Again, it resembled a friendly conversation more than an interview. Take-home assignment, coming up next!\n\n![coding](assets/blog/posts/new-job/ddb35e084b37859af442154bad4c0500f203a871-500x300.jpg)\n\nThen, a take-home assignment was set up. It was a pretty interesting experience. I got invited to a Slack channel, where I was to work with one of my potential co-workers on a task that might come up in my day-to-day job (I had to write an app using Auth0 docs and APIs). All expectations were set very clear and upfront, no guessing required: what they were looking at in the process and in the end result, how my performance will be evaluated, what success looks like, what to be aware of, and so on. I was traveling at the moment and submitted the app almost a week later.\n\nA few days after that, I got a message that the team was impressed with my app, enough to move me to the next and final stage. A call with a senior director of my potential department was set up a couple of days later, it went well. The next day I was offered the job, which I accepted.\n\n![Auth0](assets/blog/posts/new-job/6f5f2dded1630d2b10cca8b291533425ecb5c5c7-900x506.jpg)\n\n![Auth0](assets/blog/posts/new-job/e45d71bd98a06e40c477223bacb6950fd4665054-900x675.jpg)\n\nI started on December 9th as **a Developer Support Engineer** with a group of 26 newly hired colleagues from engineering, marketing, sales, administration, from all over the world. It was the first time we visited the Auth0 office. A week of intense onboarding resembled a nerdy summer camp rather than corporate orientation. It was fun :)\n\n![Auth0](assets/blog/posts/new-job/8240ea7f0e336da9be35bc93cc644f1b1c827cb5-900x676.jpg)\n\n![Auth0](assets/blog/posts/new-job/a7c3c937368393bfdebd5b9b8179956f0f05f316-900x669.jpg)\n\nAuth0 is a remote-friendly company, and the whole interview process is organized 100% online. When 60% of the company doesn’t work in the office, and the team is spread across all timezones in 35 different countries, online-first is the only approach here that makes sense. Still, for onboarding, Auth0 brings new people to Bellevue HQ.\n\n![Auth0](assets/blog/posts/new-job/35ef53c8854d23fe9cc7dc667b7f24197f3c3f49-900x1109.jpg)\n\nIt will take me some time to write about the onboarding experience and my first weeks at Auth0, but let me just say that it’s everything I’ve been wishing for and then some.

Well, not 100% finished, but got this _something_ into a usable state.\n\nIn my previous post, I outlined some of the plans for this blog. And while Social Images — one of the features I planned early on — was pretty easy to implement, this one was much more challenging.\n\n## Static Sites\n\nThis particular site is powered by Next.js 10, a fantastic framework powering millions of static websites. It’s really easy to build a static blog with Next.js, hook it up to Sanity.io, and deploy it to Vercel. Next.js is smart enough to offer both static pages, dynamic pages, and a thing they call Incremental Static Generation. With out-of-the box serverless functions integration with Vercel, truly the sky is the limit.\n\nThe biggest challenge, though, comes when you realize that your site is built once, then deployed and remains what it was at build time until you re-build and re-deploy It.\n\nClearly, some pages and features absolutely require dynamically generated pages. Take user profiles, for example, or dashboards, you get the idea. Next.js allows you to mix and match static and dynamic content, but dynamic pages do not get some of major benefits of pre-generated pages.\n\nAnd here we come to the comment sections of blogs. There’s a fair number of folks who detest blog comments, and I understand the sentiment. I’m not sure I’m a fan either, but here I am, learning stuff while building a comment section for my blog 🤷‍♂️\n\n## Comments\n\nComments are not dynamic per se. They are static when already posted. Yet, when someone posts a comment things get more complicated. A newly posted comment could trigger an entire site rebuild, or, in case of Next.js, trigger an incremental rebuild of a specific page (I’ll get to this in a moment). So this solves the issue, right? Someone posts a comment, Next.js rebuilds the page, everybody’s happy? Not exactly. Users would have to refresh the page to see their new comment: the page had been rebuilt in the background, yes, but to get this newly built page, you’d have to hit refresh. Not ideal.\n\n## Dynamic Comments on Static Sites\n\n- Well, there’s a way around this limitation as well. [stale-while-revalidate](https://web.dev/stale-while-revalidate/) to the rescue!

Well, not 100% finished, but got this <em>something</em> into a usable state.</p>\n<p>In my previous post, I outlined some of the plans for this blog. And while Social Images — one of the features I planned early on — was pretty easy to implement, this one was much more challenging.</p>\n<h2 id=\"static-sites\">Static Sites</h2>\n<p>This particular site is powered by Next.js 10, a fantastic framework powering millions of static websites. It’s really easy to build a static blog with Next.js, hook it up to Sanity.io, and deploy it to Vercel. Next.js is smart enough to offer both static pages, dynamic pages, and a thing they call Incremental Static Generation. With out-of-the box serverless functions integration with Vercel, truly the sky is the limit.</p>\n<p>The biggest challenge, though, comes when you realize that your site is built once, then deployed and remains what it was at build time until you re-build and re-deploy It.</p>\n<p>Clearly, some pages and features absolutely require dynamically generated pages. Take user profiles, for example, or dashboards, you get the idea. Next.js allows you to mix and match static and dynamic content, but dynamic pages do not get some of major benefits of pre-generated pages.</p>\n<p>And here we come to the comment sections of blogs. There’s a fair number of folks who detest blog comments, and I understand the sentiment. I’m not sure I’m a fan either, but here I am, learning stuff while building a comment section for my blog 🤷‍♂️</p>\n<h2 id=\"comments\">Comments</h2>\n<p>Comments are not dynamic per se. They are static when already posted. Yet, when someone posts a comment things get more complicated. A newly posted comment could trigger an entire site rebuild, or, in case of Next.js, trigger an incremental rebuild of a specific page (I’ll get to this in a moment). So this solves the issue, right? Someone posts a comment, Next.js rebuilds the page, everybody’s happy? Not exactly. Users would have to refresh the page to see their new comment: the page had been rebuilt in the background, yes, but to get this newly built page, you’d have to hit refresh. Not ideal.</p>\n<h2 id=\"dynamic-comments-on-static-sites\">Dynamic Comments on Static Sites</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Well, there’s a way around this limitation as well. <a href=\"https://web.dev/stale-while-revalidate/\">stale-while-revalidate</a> to the rescue!

This time, I’ve built it from scratch, with these two hands. In this post, I want to take a deep dive into what and how I built, and what’s next.",["Date","2021-01-02T20:20:20.000Z"],"Since my previous post about rebuilding this site, I’ve made enough progress to actually launch the site. You’re looking at it right now :)\n\n# Stack\n\nInitially, I planned on using [Gatsby](https://gatsbyjs.com), and I in fact built the entire site with Gatsby at its heart. But where’s fun in that?\n\n## Next.js with TypeScript\n\nWhile I was finishing the site with Gatsby, [Next.js 10](https://nextjs.org/blog/next-10) came out, and I had to try it. It's such an impressive framework, there was no way I won't give it a shot. It took me a few hours to completely replace Gatsby with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), and there's so much I love about Next! Just some of them are:\n\n- Static and dynamic generation\n- Choose your own data fetching (GROQ, GraphQL, plain fetch, you name it!)\n- Dynamic module imports\n- Awesome code-splitting\n- By-default performance and web-vitals optimization\n- Built-in image optimization\n- Built-in serverless functions (especially, when deployed to Vercel)\n\nDeveloper experience is also pretty nice. With Next's amazing flexibility and ease of use, I was able to rewrite major chunks of code trying different approaches, and it not only was a breeze, but it also allowed me to try multiple things within just a couple of hours. All told, I'm a fan. I wish [Svelte Kit](https://svelte.dev/blog/whats-the-deal-with-sveltekit) gets to the same level of maturity sometime really soon — for now, Next.js is the next best thing.\n\n## Tailwind 2\n\nI'm a huge fan of utility-first approach offered by [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com). It takes a minute to get a hang of it, but when you get it, you get it. It's fantastically easy to style elements, move them around, make things as responsive or rigid as you want. It's a truly great tool for efficient and productive web styling. While I've been working on the rewrite, Tailwind upgraded from version 1.x to 2.0, migration was a breeze.\n\n## Sanity\n\nI've selected [Sanity.io](https://sanity.io) as a CMS for my website. Some of the reasons for this decision were, in no particular order:\n\n- Fantastic flexibility in modeling data\n- Developer-first DNA\n- Full out-of-the-box GraphQL support\n- Great community and awesome documentation\n- Data portability: if Sanity doesn't work out for me, I can easily take all my data and move it wherever\n\nSo far, I love what I've built with Sanity, and I will showcase my setup in a separate post. I got so thrilled with this CMS that I've built a plugin for it: [Autocomplete Tags](https://www.sanity.io/plugins/autocomplete-tags). I use it in every project now :)\n\n## Cloudinary\n\nThe last technology I want to mention is [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com). Honestly, it was an afterthought to the large extent, and a lot needs to be done before I can claim in earnest that I'm using it. So far, all it does is \"generate\" social cover images for my posts. Try sharing this post on Facebook or Twitter to see what I mean. I will write another post about this bit as soon as I get to reworking social images.\n\n# Deployment\n\nOriginally, I was planning on deploying this site to [Netlify](https://netlify.com). I love Netlify, it's a great place to host a JAM website. However, at the time I moved from Gatsby to Next.js, Netlify was not too friendly to certain aspects of Next's powers. And given that Next.js is created by the same folks who run Vercel, I naturally just moved to [Vercel](https://vercel.com). As a result, not only did I cut build and deployment time in half, I also have access to \"real-time\" web-vitals/lighthouse analytics — it's built into both Vercel and Next.js.\n\n![Vercel Analytics](assets/blog/posts/building-this-website-part-2/ccf00c415ef6dcb0fa914b907352d765b3b5c2b4-2024x2498.png)\n\n# What’s next?\n\nThis year, I plan to make some major improvements.\n\n- Improve progressive loading for images. Now they are lazy-loaded, which is good, but I'm looking to improve the experience with progressive loading. I've implemented this and had to remove it due to its wonkiness.\n- Email subscription. With RSS effectively dead, email subscription will be the main avenue for delivering updates along with posting to social media. Low effort solution, shouldn't take long to implement.\n- Related posts. Another low-effort solution. With tags attached to every post, it's fairly easy to introduce relevant related posts at the bottom of every post.\n- Improve design. So far, I like the boldness of it, but there are things that I'd like to improve and so far I don't really know how to do it 🤷‍♂️\n- AI/ML generated image captions. Every image posted on the website will have a caption and/or alt text generated by [Microsoft's Computer Vision](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/computer-vision/)\n- Search with [Algolia](https://algolia.com) or vanilla JS. Not sure yet what route I want to go here. Vanilla JS search is easy to implement and could be as robust as I want it to be, but Algolia offers so much more than just search. I'm torn :)\n- LinkCards with metascrapper. Right now, I'm low-key using microlink.io and their React SDK to generate embedded cards for certain links. I don't like this approach for a variety of reasons, the main of them being it's a paid 3rd-party service. So I will build my own LinkCard component, with blackjack and hookers.\n- Comments. Not sure how critical these are, but definitely worth exploring. The main difficulty here is the static re-generation of post pages when new comments are posted. Next's incremental static generation should really help with this a lot.\n- Membership with [Auth0](https://auth0.com). Powered by Auth0, I will offer some sort of extra content or functionality to members.\n- Subscription with [Stripe](https://stripe.com). Mostly for the sake of learning how to do this with a JAM site.\n- Finally, a variety of post types: book reviews, podcast episodes (**yep, the podcast is returning!**), hike reports, and so on.\n\nStay tuned for more. One of my goals this year is to blog much, much more.

I'm one of a very few members of a new teem on a mission to delight customers who are just starting out with Auth0. While building teams from scratch can be challenging and stressful, it's also extremely rewarding. Just two weeks ago there was nothing, and today we are a functional organization working with customers. There's much to be discovered and figured out, but I think we've build a solid foundation for the team to grow and to reach its full potential.\n\n## Speaking of solid foundations\n\nIt's this time of the year when we contemplate our life choices and consider buying a house. Every other year we go through this, and every time we end up with how impossible it is to buy a reasonably priced home in this north of Seattle area. We've house-hunted for about a month this year, and it's absolutely wild. A decent home gets listed for, say, $550,000, recieves 25 offers and gets sold for $675,000 cash. It's entirely ridiculous and totally nuts. So we are taking a step back and considering building a house instead of buying one. So far it looks cheaper, more reasonable, but it's a ton of work and land is pretty scarce, even north of Snohomish. If you have experience with building homes, please let me know in the comments, I've got questions :)\n\n## Things to keep after the pandemic subsides\n\nThis past year normalized a lot of good things, and I want to keep some of them after the pandemic subsides.\n\n**Remote work.** This is a bit controversial. Most people don't have suitable conditions to work from home full-time, and they should be provided an option to work from an office or a nearby co-working space. However, remote work should be an equally acceptible option. Basically, it should be entirely up to employees to choose whether they prefer to work from home or office.\n\n**Wearing masks.** I feel very comfortable wearing a mask. Not only because it provides protection from other people's germs, but also because I feel more secure with my face covered. I want to be able to wear a mask whenever I want, wherever I want, and not being looked down upon.\n\n**Physical distancing.** I want to keep \"6 feet apart\" after the pandemic. I don't want to have a person breathing down my neck in line at the grocery store. I don't want to sit in a packed restaurant bumping elbows with other people. I want every place that's been functioning at 50% capacity to keep it this way. I understand that it's not going to happen for economic reasons, but one can dream...\n\n**Online-first everything.** Every store and service needs to have a fully-functional ecommerce website. I want to keep the ability to book everything online, buy stuff online, order services online. Everything that can be feasibly delivered online or to my door, should be.\n\n**Everything by appointment.** I want to keep booking appointments for everything. Picking up something from a store? I want to keep booking the exact time I'm going to come for this pickup and avoid waiting in line. DMV? I want to book my spot, come at the reserved time, and be on my way.\n\n**Normalize government footing healthcare bills.** Now that it's clear that Universal healthcare is inevitable, before it happens, I want to normalize government footing healthcare bills for critical services: vaccinations, life-saving treatment, emergency service and more. It's almost we are about to join developed nations in this regard, then why wait?\n\n**Normalize sick leave.** People should never come to work, physically or remotely, when they feel sick. They should never have to choose between taking care of their health and being paid. Sick people should be able to just take care of their health and come back to work when they feel better without losing their income.\n\nI bet there are other things that I forgot about.

Never before I was able to stick with the website I've developed for myself for so long :)\n\nIn Part 2 of this series, I outlined some new stuff that I changes since I published Part 1. Since then, I've posted a general comments overview (it's pretty cool), and described how I go around generating social images for my blog posts.\n\nToday, I want touch a little bit on some of the moving parts that are involved. It's still a more or less general overview. Eventually, I'll get to posting all the technical bits as well.\n\n## Covid Component\n\nAt the top of the home page there's a Covid component. It's a neat little thing that fetches latest data from [CovidTracking Project](https://covidtracking.com) and presents it in three nice cards. Early on I decided that I'm going to have this at the top of the page for the remainder of the pandemic. Since CovidTracking is [winding down](https://covidtracking.com/analysis-updates/covid-tracking-project-end-march-7) its data collection in March, I'd need to switch to a different source. Hopefully, sometime soon I'd switch to tracking the recovery and will remove this component entirely once we are on track to recovery.\n\nThis component uses [swr](https://swr.vercel/com) to update data and a bunch of tricks to display how it has changed since the day before. [Check it out](https://github.com/rosnovsky/rosnovsky.us/tree/main/blog/components/Covid)!\n\n## Infinite Scroll\n\nThis one is more or less standard. If you scroll to the bottom of the home page, a set of new posts will be loaded and show up. This is made so that the home page itself loads faster, while additional posts are loaded lazily on demand. This one is using `request` to fetch the next set of posts from Sanity's GraphQL endpoint, nothing fancy, but I'm still pretty proud of it. [Check it out](https://github.com/rosnovsky/rosnovsky.us/blob/eb965932fa9989dce9e62541916690d152a2eb82/blog/pages/index.tsx#L46).\n\n## GraphQL vs GROQ\n\nAn arbitrary decision that I'm still contemplating. Sanity offers GROQ as their main query language. It's a bit unusual and takes some time to wrap one's head around, and I'm almost there, I guess. But so far I'm using familiar GraphQL to fetch data. This approach introduces some unexpected challenges. For example, when fetching a blog post via GraphQL, you get main image as a reference to an actual document. With GROQ you could request this image object as well, but with GraphQL it's quite tricky and a bit convoluted. This fact is keeping me on track to switching to GROQ eventually.\n\n## Perfect is the enemy of good\n\nIt's been a constant battle between me wanting to push something to prod here and me being cautios and holding back because things are not perfect yet, not ready for prime time, so to speak.\n\nCovid component used to break with unusual data or upon some unexpected schema changes on the CovidTracking Project side. I think, I fixed most of it.\n\nInfinite scroll used to break unexpectedly. Again, appears to be fixed now.\n\nComments are an unfinished mess that actually works pretty well, although it does lack a ton of features.\n\nAll of these things are not perfect. In fact, nothing about this site is perfect. However, I decided to go ahead and push it anyway. Moreover, I push most updates almost immediately to production. So most of the time you're seeing the very latest code running the site.\n\nAt first, I really struggled with this. I'd scrap the entire project and start over because of how _imperfect_ it was getting. I'd delete entire components to start over because of this same reason: they weren't good enough. It cost me months of lost time. What I learned, though, is that\n\n- nobody cares how imperfect my blog is\n- exposing it to the world helps me move faster given your feedback\n- nothing is perfect :)\n\nIf I chose to make things perfect first and then push them, this site wouldn't go live, probably, ever. So here it is, imperfect, live, and avaialble to you to criticize and comment.

Not that my life is so packed with events that it warrants a weekly post about what’s going on. This week, however, was pretty exciting.\n\n## Vaccinated, Part 1\n\nJust over a week ago I received an email from Washington Health Department that all of a sudden I’m eligible to get my COVID vaccine. This is not the kind of situation where you ask ”why” or ”are you sure?”. I immediately went ahead and tried to book an appointment. The only place that still had one was Walgreens in Bremerton. Bremerton is a town around Naval Base Kitsap; it’s about 50 miles and a ferry ride from home. But if it's literally the last available appointment within 50 miles from home, I'll take it. And so I did. I took a day off work, and all in all, got myself a nice little road trip, 2 cruises (go ahead, convince me that taking a ferry is nothing like a cruise, I dare you!); I had my shot, lunch in a nice restaurant, and a ton of awesome pictures. My next visit to Bremerton for my second shot is scheduled for May 4.\n\n![](assets/blog/posts/weekly-update-2/elliot-bay.jpg)\n![](assets/blog/posts/weekly-update-2/seattle-skyline.jpg)\n![](assets/blog/posts/weekly-update-2/olympic-mountains.jpg)\n\nA couple of quick notes about the shot itself:\n\nThe injection site ached for about two days as if someone punched there with their fist. If you don't touch it or make certain moves that engage those specific muscles around the shot, it's easy to forget that it's there.\n\nI felt fatigued and sleepy the next day, this wore off entirely by Day 3.\n\nOther than that, my first shot was entirely uneventful.\n\n## House hunting\n\nWe are still doing this wierd house-hunting thing. As I mentioned before, the market is absolutely wild: buyers are either desperate or have way too much money, and sellers are listing houses with the expectation that they will have dozens of offers and will sell for at least 100K over their initial asking price. Real estate agents are not too interested in \"difficult\" buyers. And we are very much \"difficult\". We don't want to overpay, we have a set budget, a set of reasonable requirements for the house itself and for its location. But being reasonable can't compete with wild Californian money and desparate folks who've been hunting for a house for half a year, had dozens of their offers rejected and will do anything to get a house.\n\nWe are not in a rush, though, and are able to keep hunting. No results so far.\n\nWe are still exploring both buying and building, but chances are that we'll have to make a decision one way or another sometime fairly soon.\n\n## Home school?\n\nAnother development that I'm consumed by at the moment is withdrawing our son from school. Since before the pandemic he struggled at school, and this past year only made things worth. And since schooling is not going to change dramatically for him even when we go full in-person, we decided that we'll take matters in our own hands. So far it seems like a very doable and rewarding idea, yet it presents a bunch of challenges that we are not yet sure we know how to approach. One of the difficulties that I've encountered so far is that most homeschooling happens for religious reasons and many materials and advice based on the assumption that parents are looking for some sort of religious angle in education. Not our case, so we are looking around. Still, it's interesting and exciting. I'll keep you posted.\n\n## New therapist\n\nI started seeing a new therapist using [Talkspace](https://www.talkspace.com). I'm lucky enough to have it covered by my health insurance, and it's really convenient since sessions are all video/text in the app. So far it looks like we've connected really well, and that this new therapist is a better match for me.

",["Date","2021-06-05T00:00:00.000Z"],"Let me begin by saying that I basically gave up on these weekly updates. I mean, it's been over a month since the latest one.

And you know what? Screw this. Just because I failed to keep it up I'm not giving up. I will do my best to post more regularly now :)\n\n## House\n\n![](assets/blog/posts/weekly-update-4/home.jpg)\n\nSo, this happened.\n\nOne of the goals for this year that I set for myself was to figure out a way to buy a house in 2021. My job situation is stable, I have saved some money that would be enough to start building downpayment on, the market isn't getting any cooler anytime soon, our current landlord got to the point of being obnoxious about their constant nagging, and so on.\n\nIn March we discussed as a family whether or not we can proceed, what the timeline would be, what do we need to do and sacrifice in order to make it happen. We enlisted a real estate agent and got to work.\n\nWithin a few weeks it became painfully evident that any house we remotely like that matches our location prefrences is out of our reach. We were set on only making reasonable offers and not participate in bidding wars, and as a result we've got outbid a few times. A few times we decided not to make an offer when it became clear that a particular house would get multiple offers that were likely to go over $50k over asking price.\n\nAbout three weeks into the house hunting, we became pretty discouraged: we could barely afford tiny fixer-uppers in less than desirable places, and we still been only making losing offers. We began expending our search area, but we were not yet ready to compomise on other house parameters. We also were not ready to change our highest price that we were willing to pay.\n\nThen one day in early April I went to view two houses in Arlington. They were for sale as of that day, and they were conveniently located on one street. By the time I got there 40 minutes later, both houses turned from \"for sale\" to \"sale pending\" — they got offers while I was driving to view them! By some wierd coincidence, there was one other house for sale on that same street that I missed in my search. I let my agent know that we'd consider this other house and asked them to figure out what's what.\n\nThe house ended up being in a decent condition, but required a bunch of interior work. We visited it, walked around, and decided that it's good enough for the price. We made an offer $5K over their asking price, with home inspection and financing contangancies — something very rare in Seattle metro area. Our thinking was that if we think this house is not worth more, and we want to fully inspect it and have it properly appraised. We liked the neighborhood a lot, even though Arlington itself is waaay further than what we considered perfect.\n\n![](assets/blog/posts/weekly-update-4/neighborhood.jpg)\n\nIn mid-May, we closed the sale and are getting ready to move in by the end of June. I drive there almost daily after work, doing minor repairs, working with contractors that do major upgrades, meeting neighbors, etc. My wife had painted the garage last week, and overall things are coming together pretty nicely.\n\n![](assets/blog/posts/weekly-update-4/garage.jpg)\n\n![](assets/blog/posts/weekly-update-4/neighborhood2.jpg)\n\n![](assets/blog/posts/weekly-update-4/sunset.jpg)\n\n![](assets/blog/posts/weekly-update-4/radish.jpg)\n\n## Fully Vaccinated\n\nWe are now a fully vaccinated household. Even though my son is still waiting for his second shot, for most intents and purposes, we consider our household to be fully vaxxed.\n\nGetting vaccinated in Washington was and remains easy. Vaccine doses are available without an appointment, it takes 15 minutes to get a shot, and it brings you that much closer to getting _back to normal_. I'm no longer wearing a mask in stores unless I'm speaking with someone at close range, and even then I'd first ask them if they prefer that I wear a mask.\n\nAs of today, [69% of Washington residents are fully vaccinated](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/06/03/us/virus-vaccine-states.html) for COVID-19. We will reach heard immunity threshold of 70% within a couple of days.\n\n## Work\n\nWork has been interesting. For starters, my team just won a Hackath0n at work :) With dozens of teams participating, it's pretty wild that our little project got enough votes. The experience itself was not exactly what I wanted it to be, but I'll make it work better next time around.\n\nOur (still) fairly new team is still figuring stuff out. We are setting up a major new programm at Auth0, and it's a massive undertaking for the four of us. There's been very little engineering lately, but we are setting up things in a way that would free up a lot of time and resources to do fun stuff soon.\n\nOh, and this week I will launch a live Auth0 Best Practices webinar for customers participating in the program we are building for them. Should be exiting, fun and terrifying :)\n\n## Updating this website\n\nIt's time to admit it: this website is never going to be finished. It's my playground where I try things all the time, rebuild, remake, change and start from scratch. This is exactly what happened this week.\n\nI've been following [Lee Robinson](https://leerob.io) for a while and really like how clean and simple his website is. Since Lee's license allowed derivative work, I decided to pull the trigger and rebuild this site based on his setup.\n\nI've updated it to use Typescript, added [Algolia](https://algolia.com)-powered full-text search, implemented Auth0 login, and made a few other improvements. It's still mostly Lee's design, look and feel, but I'm determined to make it my own, slowly but surely.\n\nOne of the reasons to draw inspiration from an expert is that not only do you get exposed to the best practices right away, it gives you a chance to see where you can do better than someone you respect. You know, good artists copy, great artists steal. I don't know what decent artists do, but I like to think that copying some, stealing some, and then using either as inspiration for something truly yours makes me a decent artist ;)\n\n![](assets/blog/posts/weekly-update-4/lighthouse.jpg)\n\nComments are coming soon, [RSS](https://rosnovsky.us/feed/feed.xml) is available already, podcast pages are in the works, but in the meantime, feel free to subscribe to the newsletter.

I drive there almost daily after work, doing minor repairs, working with contractors that do major upgrades, meeting neighbors, etc. My wife had painted the garage last week, and overall things are coming together pretty nicely.</p>\n<p><img __ASTRO_IMAGE_=\"{&#x22;src&#x22;:&#x22;assets/blog/posts/weekly-update-4/garage.jpg&#x22;,&#x22;alt&#x22;:&#x22;&#x22;,&#x22;index&#x22;:0}\"></p>\n<p><img __ASTRO_IMAGE_=\"{&#x22;src&#x22;:&#x22;assets/blog/posts/weekly-update-4/neighborhood2.jpg&#x22;,&#x22;alt&#x22;:&#x22;&#x22;,&#x22;index&#x22;:0}\"></p>\n<p><img __ASTRO_IMAGE_=\"{&#x22;src&#x22;:&#x22;assets/blog/posts/weekly-update-4/sunset.jpg&#x22;,&#x22;alt&#x22;:&#x22;&#x22;,&#x22;index&#x22;:0}\"></p>\n<p><img __ASTRO_IMAGE_=\"{&#x22;src&#x22;:&#x22;assets/blog/posts/weekly-update-4/radish.jpg&#x22;,&#x22;alt&#x22;:&#x22;&#x22;,&#x22;index&#x22;:0}\"></p>\n<h2 id=\"fully-vaccinated\">Fully Vaccinated</h2>\n<p>We are now a fully vaccinated household. Even though my son is still waiting for his second shot, for most intents and purposes, we consider our household to be fully vaxxed.</p>\n<p>Getting vaccinated in Washington was and remains easy. Vaccine doses are available without an appointment, it takes 15 minutes to get a shot, and it brings you that much closer to getting <em>back to normal</em>. I’m no longer wearing a mask in stores unless I’m speaking with someone at close range, and even then I’d first ask them if they prefer that I wear a mask.</p>\n<p>As of today, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/06/03/us/virus-vaccine-states.html\">69% of Washington residents are fully vaccinated</a> for COVID-19. We will reach heard immunity threshold of 70% within a couple of days.</p>\n<h2 id=\"work\">Work</h2>\n<p>Work has been interesting. For starters, my team just won a Hackath0n at work :) With dozens of teams participating, it’s pretty wild that our little project got enough votes. The experience itself was not exactly what I wanted it to be, but I’ll make it work better next time around.</p>\n<p>Our (still) fairly new team is still figuring stuff out. We are setting up a major new programm at Auth0, and it’s a massive undertaking for the four of us. There’s been very little engineering lately, but we are setting up things in a way that would free up a lot of time and resources to do fun stuff soon.</p>\n<p>Oh, and this week I will launch a live Auth0 Best Practices webinar for customers participating in the program we are building for them. Should be exiting, fun and terrifying :)</p>\n<h2 id=\"updating-this-website\">Updating this website</h2>\n<p>It’s time to admit it: this website is never going to be finished. It’s my playground where I try things all the time, rebuild, remake, change and start from scratch. This is exactly what happened this week.</p>\n<p>I’ve been following <a href=\"https://leerob.io\">Lee Robinson</a> for a while and really like how clean and simple his website is. Since Lee’s license allowed derivative work, I decided to pull the trigger and rebuild this site based on his setup.</p>\n<p>I’ve updated it to use Typescript, added <a href=\"https://algolia.com\">Algolia</a>-powered full-text search, implemented Auth0 login, and made a few other improvements. It’s still mostly Lee’s design, look and feel, but I’m determined to make it my own, slowly but surely.</p>\n<p>One of the reasons to draw inspiration from an expert is that not only do you get exposed to the best practices right away, it gives you a chance to see where you can do better than someone you respect. You know, good artists copy, great artists steal. I don’t know what decent artists do, but I like to think that copying some, stealing some, and then using either as inspiration for something truly yours makes me a decent artist ;)</p>\n<p><img __ASTRO_IMAGE_=\"{&#x22;src&#x22;:&#x22;assets/blog/posts/weekly-update-4/lighthouse.jpg&#x22;,&#x22;alt&#x22;:&#x22;&#x22;,&#x22;index&#x22;:0}\"></p>\n<p>Comments are coming soon, <a href=\"https://rosnovsky.us/feed/feed.xml\">RSS</a> is available already, podcast pages are in the works, but in the meantime, feel free to subscribe to the newsletter.

This flaw makes these images invisible for people who access the web using screen readers. So I decided to fix this using AI, computer vision, and serverless functions.\n\n## Concept\n\nWhenever I add an image to a blog post, I want this image to be analyzed by an AI. I want the AI to describe an image and append alt text to it if none exists. Since I use [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/), and I don't want to spend too much on this operation, I want this analysis to happen only at build time.\n\n## Tools\n\nThere's a while variety of accessible cloud-base computer vision tools:\n\n- [Google Vision AI](https://cloud.google.com/vision/)\n- [AWS Computer Vision](https://aws.amazon.com/computer-vision/)\n- [Azure Cognitive Services](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/computer-vision/)\n\nNone of these services is perfect; in my tests, though, Azure came on top as the most accurate when it comes to image descriptions.\n\nSince, again, I'm using Next.js, I don't have to do anything extra to deploy a serverless function that would request image analysis. I can do this right from within Next.js by just adding a file to /pages/api/ folder. The function will be available at https://rosnovsky.us/api/.\n\nThat's it. All we need is a cloud-based computer vision service and a way to deploy a serverless function.\n\n## Bringing it all together\n\n### Serverless function\n\nFirst, let's create a serverelss function called pictureDescription. This function will accept image URL, reach out to Azure with this URL, and return alt text it recieves in response from Azure.\n\nThis function will return something like this:\n\n### MDX Component\n\nNow, to the MDX Component. This component allows you to use React components right in your MDX. Let's create a funtion that would take image path, width, height and (optionally) alt text. If alt text is supplied, the component will just return Next.js' [Image component](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/next/image) with existing alt. However, if I forgot to supply alt text, the function will call our API, fetch alt text, and add it to the Image component. If there was an error fetching alt text, an \"I'm sorry\" text will populate alt text.\n\nThat's it. Now, whenever I include ImageWithAlt component in my MDX, it gets an alt text in case there were none.\n\nCheck this out:\n\n![](assets/blog/posts/alt-text/1661cf98394e1a5dacfc6b00cdd70e9e25ca9b0e-1134x2016.avif)\n\nThis image had no alt text so Azure generated one for us.\n\n## Final thoughts\n\nThere are a few caveats with this approach. First, obviously, its inaccuracy. While a generic description is better than no description, it certainly lacks accuracy. I hope that with time AI vision and analysis algorithms will get better at it. Second, an image has to be publically available on the web at build time. This requires me to first deploy the site with just images for an upcoming post and then redeploy it when I actually publish the post. Arguably, one could just deploy both images and the post at the same time and then just redeploy it again, but neither is great. Something to think about.\n\nP.S.

However, so far it's been lacking documentation. Here's how to configure Twilio SIP Trunk with Unifi Talk.",["Date","2021-08-06T00:00:00.000Z"],"For those of us in the Unifi ecosystem, Unifi Talk is a cheap and really nice way to add home or home office phone to your network. I'm not 100% sure if a lot of folks still _require_ a home phone, but I thought \"why not\" and went ahead and configured it.\n\nI own Unifi Dream Machine Pro, and someday I'll create an overview of my network, but for now, I'll just focus on the phone configuration. I bought Unifi Touch, a nice-looking traditional phone device. You plug it in, set it up at unifi.ui.com, and you're good to go with a trial number provided by Ubiquity. From this point, you can make and recieve phone calls. Easy.\n\nNow, since there's no adventure in this, I decided to add and use my own SIP with Unifi Talk. Now we are talking! Unfortunately, the documentation around this is minimal and lacking in detail. I'm going to try to document my process here.\n\n## Twilio\n\nFirst things first. You need a Twilio account. You can sign up for a free trial at [twilio.com](www.twilio.com/referral/eaToLe) and buy a phone number (it's $1). With this new phone number in hand, head over to Voice services. There, in \"Manage\" section we'll create a SIP domain. You'll have something like `mydomain.sip.twilio.com` as your SIP domain. This part is pretty straightforward, and you could just use the default settings except for the IP address and credentials. You'd need to add an external IP address of your UDM (or upstream router), and for credentials, **use your phone number as username** (with country code, without `+`, e.g. `12345678910`). Leave everything else as-is, save, and let's deal with the SIP BYOC part.\n\n> **Note:** This `username === phone number without +` is one of the biggest missing pieces in every doc I've found on the subject. Apparently, when there's an inbound call, Unifi Talk will use the `username` to route the call to the correct phone/user/extension. If this username is not the same as your phone number, you'll get an error along the lines of \"No route exists, aborting\" (you can check this by SSHing into your UDM-Pro, running `unifi-os shell`, then `fs_cli` and making an inbound call).\n\nBYOC stands for \"Bring Your Own Carrier\", which is what we are doing here. To make this entire SIP thingy work, we need to add a SIP trunk to Twilio, and instruct Twilio to use this SIP trunk for all incoming and outgoing calls.\n\nHead over to BYOC trunks and create one. We will need a few items here:\n\n- Termination SIP Domain (we just created one!)\n- From Domain\n- Origination Connection Policy\n\nSet both Termination SIP Domain and From domain to the one we've already created.\n\nGo ahead and create an Origination Connection Policy. This is where we'll tell Twilio to use our SIP trunk for all outgoing calls. Here you will need your external IP addreass again and add it as `sip:1.2.3.4:6767`. Leave `weight` and `priority` as default, but make sure your sip address points to the port `6767`. Save and you're done with Twilio side.\n\n## Unifi Talk\n\nNow the fun part. Head over to your Talk application, Settings > System Settings > Add Third-Party SIP Provider. A few things are important here:\n\n- Custom Fields\n- DID Number(s)\n- ACL IP addresses\n\nLet's begin with the Custom Fields. We need to add a few things here:\n\n- `proxy` - this is the SIP domain we created earlier, but with a caveat: instead of `mydomain.sip.twilio.com`, you'll need to use `mydomain.pstn.umatilla.twilio.com` - this is a localized SIP trunk domain (`umatilla` here stands for US-West Oregon and `pstn` indicates that it's a trunk, roughly speaking)\n- `username` - your phone number without `+`\n- `password` - your password (from when you've created your SIP domain credentials)\n- `register` - `false` (this is important!)\n- `transport` - `tcp` (I'm not sure it actually does anything)\n- `dtmf-type` - `rfc2833` (this, again, may not do anything)\n\nNext, let's add the phone number. Type it in as a proper `E.164` number, e.g. `+12345678910` and hit `Enter`. Done!\n\nFinally, ACL domain ranges. I've added two, specific to my US-West Oregon region: `54.244.51.0/30` and `54.244.51.0/24` (the last number is the CIDR). This is important, because Unifi Talk will only accept calls from these IP addresses. If you're going with a different Twilio region, find the proper ranges for your region here: [Twilio's IP addresses for SIP services](https://www.twilio.com/docs/sip-trunking/ip-addresses). Add both Signaling and Media IP ranges.\n\nWe are almost done! Save this new Third-Party SIP Provider, and head back to the System Settings. Toggle \"Create Static Signaling Port\" to `true`, and make sure that if you have an upstream router, it will proparly forward the port `6767` to the port `6767` of your UDM-Pro.\n\n## Final Touch\n\nNow all you need to do is assign your new phone number to a user and their phone device. Head over to the \"Users and Groups\", click \"Edit\", then \"Manage\", and in \"CHANGE PHONE NUMBER\" select your new SIP number. Save, and you are done!","src/content/blog/2021/08/06/twillio-and-unifi-talk.md",[1779],"@assets/blog/posts/twillio-and-unifi-talk/dashboard.png","33f7fa5eef27c5de",{html:1782,metadata:1783},"<p>For those of us in the Unifi ecosystem, Unifi Talk is a cheap and really nice way to add home or home office phone to your network.

I appreciate those of you actually reading this, but by and large there are very few people who came here to read my stuff. Arguably, it's not too profound or deep or insightful, so it's totally fine; it's obscure by design, I guess.\n\nAnd yet, it's still writing in public. And coding in public. And I've been working on comments to make it possible for you to leave whatever feedback you may have. However, recently I started journaling in private, just for myself. And on paper, with a pen.

I forgot how it feels; I used to keep a journal in high school, but then life happened and I've never got back to journaling since. There was a few months of Bullet Journaling, but it ended when I broke my leg.\n\nThis time, I've been transitioning into more mindful work and life. As a part of this transition, I've been moving away from many digital tools that I've been using for years towards their analog analogs (see what I did here?) I'm running a paper-only to-do list, I track time with a physical timer, I'm taking meeting notes in a notepad, I'm planning work on paper, and finally, I'm keeping a journal. I'll talk about all these other things sometime later, but for now, I'm going to focus on the journal.\n\n## Journal\n\nI've got like a dozen different notebooks, notepads, journals and composition books. I wanted to make this habit last, and knowing myself well enough, I knew that I had to try everything that I may potentially like before settling on one \"perfect\" journal.\n\nMeet [Leuchtturm1917 Composition Notebook B5](https://www.leuchtturm1917.us/notebook-composition-b5-ruled-softcover-121-numbered-pages-emerald.html) (soft cover).\n\n![](assets/blog/posts/journaling/4d149d14394fad03294cb36fc3f71105b4673534-788x1280.avif)\n\n![](assets/blog/posts/journaling/be645509e0852d4830d6f5f1b670f12fdfa57910-1000x445.avif)\n\nIt's fantastically simple and plain, nothing fancy, really. But I love it. So much so that I've got two more - for the future.\n\nThe pages are nice and clean with a hint of creme (they are not bright white, which is great). They are ruled, numbered, and have a space for the date/topic. The pages are also great for fountain pens, they allow very little bleeding and are very easy to write on. Two string bookmarks to keep things easily accessible is another nice feature of this Leuchtturm1917. Finally, the cover is soft but thick enough to protect the journal. There's also, of course, a pocket at the end cover.\n\n![](assets/blog/posts/journaling/dab5bb5de60530dc514ca743b52b3a76932da10c-1000x563.avif)\n\n## Pens\n\nPens have been an obsession for me for a very long time. I have been using fountain pens - my favorites - for a while now. For this \"project\" I bought a few \"special\" pens, [Pilot Cavaliers](https://www.jetpens.com/Pilot-Cavalier-Fountain-Pen-Metallic-Pearl-White-Medium-Nib/pd/22744) (extra fine, fine and medium nibs).\n\n![](assets/blog/posts/journaling/15d4a5b1c9bf7279067b1d25806d0e01343536b6-1000x563.avif)\n\n![](assets/blog/posts/journaling/dc8937c78f0e62b685a4a03ba6dc69979778d04e-2268x4032.avif)\n\nI don't have an explanation why I prefer fountain pens, but they are just so satisfying to write with! You could use different ink with the same pen, refills are cheap, and there's a lot of variety. Anyhow, this is what it looks like (featuring iPhone 13 Pro's macro mode)\n\n![](assets/blog/posts/journaling/98f7165faa91f2e826db03a0b57fd572de68c591-1000x563.avif)\n\n## HP Sprocket\n\n![](assets/blog/posts/journaling/4f9fd1faf8a132ad617c76545b422f50964a3afe-1000x563.avif)\n\nFinally, I'm using something to make my journal a bit more lively than it would otherwise be. I've got a tiny [HP Sprocket](https://sprocketprinters.com/) printer to feature little pictures along with the text. It looks really nice, and certainly adds some color to the journal.\n\n![](assets/blog/posts/journaling/cd0069454374ae28fd083ef77828584fc265b2f8-400x225.gif)\n\nOverall, these past few month of private journaling were incredible. It's \"_thinking on paper_\" as Leuchtturm1917 put it. And I know, I know, it's no big deal for a lot of people, but for me it's been a very calming, meditation-like experience, that helped alleviate a lot of pent-up anxiety, get my thoughts an feelings in order (and in a very tangible way), got me more mindful and present.

Worth every penny, every minute, and I'm so glad I attended. Fantastic speakers, incredible community, family vibes, and a lot of fun - this is CascadiaJS I've enjoyed this year.\n\nI've got a few general takeaways, a bunch of specific things I want to share, and some notes on what I learned.\n\n![](assets/blog/posts/cascadiajs-2021/08b8509e78d22e88095a33dac1f3229dc36494ac-1086x724.avif)Notes from CascadiaJS 2021)\n\n> All talks, slides, and graphic recordings will be available on [CascadiaJS 2021 website](https://2021.cascadiajs.com/) within the next couple of weeks. Don't miss it!\n\n## General takeaways\n\n- If you want to attend a virtual conference, **take time off work** to do so. I've been making the mistake of watching talks on a second screen while working in the past; never again. Engaging, being fully emerged, and being able to take notes without the distraction of work is priceless.\n- **Taking notes is key**. Watching passively is fun and all, but if you really want to take something away from the presentation, take notes. Not going to lie, I love [taking notes](/blog/journaling), but I bet you'll find it to be valuable too!\n- If you're attending a workshop, don't think that a question you have is stupid or irrelevant; **others have this same question as well, or had this question in the past**. ASK AWAY!\n- If you're following along during a workshop and something goes wrong, figure out whether it's something you can fix later. If so, **keep following along** and fix the issue later. Just assume that everything is working as presented. However, if it's something you can't fix or don't know how to fix, absolutely ASK FOR HELP! This is the entire reason for the workshop in question!\n\n> During the [dApps workshop](https://2021.cascadiajs.com/workshops/dapps) this year, I had an issue with [RedwoodJS](https://redwoodjs.com/) and couldn't get it to work. Since the focus of the workshop was to get a smart contract on the local Ethereum network, I focused on this part and was able to replace Redwood with [Next](https://nextjs.org/) later to get things working.\n\n- **Doodle if you can**. Cascadia had these awesome live graphic recordings that were not only incredibly helpful and fun to watch, but they also inspired me to explore \"doodling\" as a way to take notes. The recorder was amazing [Ashton Rodenhiser](https://twitter.com/mindseyeccf), and I will be taking her course \"[Sketchnote All the Things](https://store.mindseyecreative.ca/sketchnote)\" as soon as I can.\n- If you feel lost, **take a break and re-watch the talk later**. There's no point in trying to understand something while falling behind, getting frustrated and discouraged, and giving up.

You could watch speakers give talks on youtube any day of the year, but having them in the room, available for live Q&A, with other like-minded people around is the stuff.\n\n## Specifics\n\n- Like it or not, [blockchain](https://www.theverge.com/22654785/blockchain-explained-cryptocurrency-what-is-stake-nft) **is here to stay**. It's not going away, and if you're in the tech space, you will have to either use it, work on it, or develop for it sometime in the foreseeable future.\n- Responsive Components are coming to the CSS spec soon. You'll be able to **make specific boxes responsive**, not just the whole page. And by responsive, I don't just mean size, but also font sizes, colors, layouts - all the things you'd normally have to do to make a website responsive, just for individual components.\n- The most basic things can give you an expansive space for experimentation. Think `window.open()`: apparently, there's a whole world there, and you can use it in many fun ways.\n- If you want to learn something, **give a talk about it**. If you don't want to do it in public, make it an internal talk and give it to your team.\n- Field data > Lighthouse. Web Vitals all things, and track performance based on **real user experience**.\n- [WASM](https://webassembly.org/) is still an enigma to me. [Aaron Turner](https://github.com/torch2424) did a great job of explaining it, but I got lost and will try again later. Perhaps, I just don't have a real use-case for it yet and thus its value escapes me.\n- There are some basic things you need to learn about JS before learning React, but you can learn them _while_ learning React. I mean, React pays the bills, but you have **better chances of success** if you're learning JS basics as soon as you can.\n- Smart contracts are basically just functions that require a compatible blockchain to run on. It's not rocket science, but given that there are dozens of blockchains, and [Ehtereum](https://ethereum.org/) being ridiculously expensive, you may spend a lot of time learning specific implementations of smart contracts (think [Solidity](https://soliditylang.org/)). Start with Solidity and go from there.\n- Sensible encapsulation with React Hooks could make your life more DRY, but you'd need to really think **what to encapsulate and how**.\n- **There are super fun things to play with**. With ML widely available to the JS developers (think [TensorJS](https://www.tensorflow.org/js), [ML5](https://ml5js.org/), etc.), you can make all sorts of cool things based, for example, on computer vision. Some of these things have huge real-world value. For example, gaze detection could be used by people with mobility limitations to not only navigate apps but also to build them. I personally use [computer vision to add `alt` text to images](/blog/2021/07/07/alt-text) on this site. It's not perfect, but it's a start.\n- If you brush the cryptocurrency hype off of blockchain concepts, you'll end up with the core of Web3. Web3 in many ways is a return to Web's roots of being decentralized, but with a ton of control in the hands of the users. \"**Open Web: this time we mean it**\".\n- You should treat **your internal tools as production software**, and your teammates are your customers. Think of their experience as DX you want to provide.\n- **Refactoring and code migrations are \"human work\"** more than \"code work\". Buy-in, marketing, and support of your refactoring work are not optional.\n- **Typescript is a wild beast** and you need to hunt it down! :)\n\n```typescript\ntype ValKeys<V> = {\n  [K in keyof V]-?: (Exclude<V[K], null>)\n    extends {a: U, b: U} ? isTruthy<U>\n    extends true ? K : never : never}[keyof V]\n};\n```\n\n- Seriously, though: a lot of Typescript looks beyond intimidating sometimes, but if you dissect and expand it, you'll find it easier to understand.\n- If you're interested in cartography on the Web, **begin with exploring data layer and UI layer concepts, vector tiles, and GeoJSON**. Another interesting thing to think about is that maps should be responsive in all three dimensions(xyz), not just two as is the case with websites.\n- Whatever tool you're building, you have to **think about _how_ it will be used to abuse others** (not **if** it will be used for abuse). You must figure out a balance between privacy and safety, and it's a hell of a task.\n- **NPM and the entire JS ecosystem is wild**: this site, for example, relies on thousands of packages created by thousands of people, and I have to trust the entire supply chain. We had issues with this sort of thing [in the past](https://thehackernews.com/2021/10/malicious-npm-libraries-caught.html), and supply chain attacks are not going away. There are [tools](https://socket.security/) that can help, though, and tracking simple things (like typos in package names) is a good start.\n\nI missed two awesome talks and I'll update this page as I get them.\n\n## CascadiaJS 2022\n\n![](assets/blog/posts/cascadiajs-2021/4db36590c9ab23332ebe1b4e4c6b87da94b534e5-3500x1882.avif)\n\nI don't know if I'll be able to make it, but that's the plan.\n\n## Notes\n\n### Day 1\n\n![](assets/blog/posts/cascadiajs-2021/ef2922758eb0777d1b6e8a3cd37b4964fd766929-1000x1468.avif)\n![](assets/blog/posts/cascadiajs-2021/7e9458bf0ebd514e89197c5f7756fa94e3f9f67d-1000x1426.avif)\n![](assets/blog/posts/cascadiajs-2021/a62f12d0febaa0920f6f8ce2959e49a563ebae8c-1000x1473.avif)\n\n### Day 2\n\n![](assets/blog/posts/cascadiajs-2021/043d93499e585ef79237cdd82b4636d209b0a9be-1000x1442.avif)\n![](assets/blog/posts/cascadiajs-2021/2184f74e42bc7fde1804f637bd1ba4904b004d19-1000x1419.avif)\n![](assets/blog/posts/cascadiajs-2021/f32a113652ad3d13190749e4f548ef3b44eafc2b-1000x1451.avif)\n![](assets/blog/posts/cascadiajs-2021/8cc1dc33c41ac5643aea8ea916a4f6f408a89d72-1000x1559.avif)","src/content/blog/2021/11/04/cascadiajs-2021.md",[1885,1886,1887,1888,1889,1890,1891,1892,1893,1894],"assets/blog/posts/cascadiajs-2021/08b8509e78d22e88095a33dac1f3229dc36494ac-1086x724.avif","assets/blog/posts/cascadiajs-2021/4db36590c9ab23332ebe1b4e4c6b87da94b534e5-3500x1882.avif","assets/blog/posts/cascadiajs-2021/ef2922758eb0777d1b6e8a3cd37b4964fd766929-1000x1468.avif","assets/blog/posts/cascadiajs-2021/7e9458bf0ebd514e89197c5f7756fa94e3f9f67d-1000x1426.avif","assets/blog/posts/cascadiajs-2021/a62f12d0febaa0920f6f8ce2959e49a563ebae8c-1000x1473.avif","assets/blog/posts/cascadiajs-2021/043d93499e585ef79237cdd82b4636d209b0a9be-1000x1442.avif","assets/blog/posts/cascadiajs-2021/2184f74e42bc7fde1804f637bd1ba4904b004d19-1000x1419.avif","assets/blog/posts/cascadiajs-2021/f32a113652ad3d13190749e4f548ef3b44eafc2b-1000x1451.avif","assets/blog/posts/cascadiajs-2021/8cc1dc33c41ac5643aea8ea916a4f6f408a89d72-1000x1559.avif","@assets/blog/posts/cascadiajs-2021/08b8509e78d22e88095a33dac1f3229dc36494ac-1086x724.avif","cf250bc8cd5db370",{html:1897,metadata:1898},"<p>For years I wanted to attend <a href=\"https://cascadiajs.com\">CascadiaJS 2021</a>, a PNW-native JavaScript conference.

Engaging, being fully emerged, and being able to take notes without the distraction of work is priceless.</li>\n<li><strong>Taking notes is key</strong>. Watching passively is fun and all, but if you really want to take something away from the presentation, take notes. Not going to lie, I love <a href=\"/blog/journaling\">taking notes</a>, but I bet you’ll find it to be valuable too!</li>\n<li>If you’re attending a workshop, don’t think that a question you have is stupid or irrelevant; <strong>others have this same question as well, or had this question in the past</strong>. ASK AWAY!</li>\n<li>If you’re following along during a workshop and something goes wrong, figure out whether it’s something you can fix later. If so, <strong>keep following along</strong> and fix the issue later. Just assume that everything is working as presented. However, if it’s something you can’t fix or don’t know how to fix, absolutely ASK FOR HELP! This is the entire reason for the workshop in question!</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p>During the <a href=\"https://2021.cascadiajs.com/workshops/dapps\">dApps workshop</a> this year, I had an issue with <a href=\"https://redwoodjs.com/\">RedwoodJS</a> and couldn’t get it to work.

Here's how I made it works.",["Date","2021-11-01T00:00:00.000Z"],"> This whole thing requires that you have an active paid Apple Developer account. It's $100/yr and is not worth it unless you plan on using it for something else besides \"current music\"\n\nApple Music is my primary music service. I do listen to Spotify every now and again (their recomendation engine is unmatched), but being an Apple household, it makes sense to mostly use Apple Music.\n\nWhen I started working on this blog, I took a lot of inspiration from Lee Robinson. He has this little Spotify widget displaying the current song, and while it was easy to adapt and use it, it was not what I wanted. What I wanted was a widget displaying the last song I listened to on Apple Music. Which, apparently, is not trivial.\n\n## Apple Music API\n\nFor the longest time I couldn't find a way to use Apple's MusicKit or Music API on the web. Their developer documentation is pretty poor, especially when it comes to the web stuff. At last, I figured that I'm looking for the user listening history, and there's an API endpoint for that.\n\nThis endpoint requires two different authorization tokens: `Developer token` & `user music token`. With the `Developer token`, one could query and perform actions within the Music store. And with the `user music token`, one could query and perform actions within the user's music library. So, how do you get those?\n\n## Getting tokens\n\nNow, the deal with the two tokens is that they are totally different, unrelated, yet somewhat connected: You need _both_ in order to fetch music history.\n\nThe developer token is a JWT that you build yourself, and sign with a private key you get at the Apple deloper portal. [More on this here](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/applemusicapi/getting_keys_and_creating_tokens).\n\nThe user music token appears to be some kind of opaque token, which you can only get after a user explicitly logs into their Apple Music account and grants your app access to their Apple Music account. So far, I was unable to find a way to generate or obtain this token programmatically. What's worse, this token expires after 6 months (fixed) and there's no way to renew it.\n\nThis last bit matters because in this whole equasion, you can generate the developer token yourself. You can obtain the user music token. But from here, you cannot update the user token, so in 6 months you'll _have to_ generate a new one, in the browser, by logging in, manually, as some sort of animal.\n\nFInally, it's a quest to figure out _how_ to get this user token, and crappy docs don't really help. Here's how you do it:\n\n- Scaffold an HTML page with a `<script>` tag pointing to the MusicKit script\n- Add \"Sign in with Apple\" button to the page (here's how)\n- Deploy the app (to Vercel or Netlify, or wherever, otherwise you'd have to work around a bunch of issues)\n- Login on this newly deployed page, grant it access to your Apple Music account\n- Open Developer Tools, and in \"Storage\" section find the token OR add `<script>console.log(response)</script>` to the page and just copy the token from console. Feel free to try it out [here]()\n\nNot very intuitive, but it works. Now you have 6 months to use this token, and after that you'd need to do the same thing again.\n\nAs for the Developer token, I used Auth0's `jsonwebtoken` library. It allows you to both sign and verify JWT tokens. I store my private and public keys in environment variables, and sign the token like this:\n\n```typescript\nimport jwt from 'jsonwebtoken';\n\nconst generateToken = async (): string => {\n  const privateKey = process.env.PRIVATE_KEY;\n  const keyId = process.env.KEY_ID;\n  const teamId = process.env.TEAM_ID;\n\n  const developerToken = jwt.sign(\n    {},\n    `-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\\n` +\n      privateKey +\n      `\\n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----`,\n    {\n      algorithm: 'ES256',\n      keyid: keyId,\n      issuer: teamId,\n      expiresIn: '5s',\n    }\n  );\n\n  return developerToken;\n};\n```\n\nThat's about it. Now, that you've got both tokens, everything else is pretty straightforward.\n\n## Fetching Last Played songs\n\nThe API itself is fairly conventional. The only specific thing about is is that it's poorly docimented (you don't know for sure what shape the response object will be for different resources) and the fact that you need to supply both Bearer token for Authorization header and a `user-music-token` as a different header. With both tokens in hand, it might look something like this:\n\n```typescript\nconst getLastPlayedAppleMusicTrack = async () => {\n\n  return fetch('https://api.music.apple.com/v1/me/recent/played/tracks?types=songs' {\n    headers: {\n        Authorization: `Bearer ${APPLE_DEV_TOKEN}`,\n        'Music-User-Token': `${APPLE_USER_TOKEN}`\n    }\n  });\n}\n```\n\nIn response you'll get something like this:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"id\": \"994724222\",\n  \"type\": \"songs\",\n  \"href\": \"/v1/catalog/us/songs/994724222\",\n  \"attributes\": {\n    \"previews\": [\n      {\n        \"url\": \"https://audio-ssl.itunes.apple.com/itunes-assets/AudioPreview125/v4/10/fd/80/10fd8022-fcc4-682b-f987-3f56a35de1a5/mzaf_6476922705197379324.plus.aac.p.m4a\"\n      }\n    ],\n    \"artwork\": {\n      \"width\": 1412,\n      \"height\": 1412,\n      \"url\": \"https://is5-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music124/v4/65/07/df/6507dfce-ca4f-254e-3eae-6fc2ad4e255b/5nizza.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpg\",\n      \"bgColor\": \"ffffff\",\n      \"textColor1\": \"1a0c06\",\n      \"textColor2\": \"023c17\",\n      \"textColor3\": \"483c38\",\n      \"textColor4\": \"356346\"\n    },\n    \"artistName\": \"5'nizza\",\n    \"url\": \"https://music.apple.com/us/album/%D1%8F-%D0%BD%D0%B5-%D1%82%D0%BE%D0%B9/994724217?i=994724222\",\n    \"discNumber\": 1,\n    \"genreNames\": [\"Reggae\", \"Music\"],\n    \"durationInMillis\": 166640,\n    \"releaseDate\": \"2003-11-07\",\n    \"name\": \"Я не той…\",\n    \"isrc\": \"UALA11500030\",\n    \"hasLyrics\": true,\n    \"albumName\": \"Пятница\",\n    \"playParams\": {\n      \"id\": \"994724222\",\n      \"kind\": \"song\"\n    },\n    \"trackNumber\": 2\n  }\n}\n```\n\nKeep in mind that this shape is not set in stone, and some songs will have all these attributes, some will not (at least that was the case for me).\n\n## Showing off\n\nFinally, you'd want to show visitors what you've got. This is the easy part (haha).\n\nI'm a huge fan of [SWR](https://swr.vercel.app) - Stale While Revalidate. It's a great way to cache data, refetch stale data, and just generally have a robust way of updating things every now and then without reloading the page or requiring a user action.\n\nHere's the most basic example:\n\n```typescript\nimport useSWR from 'swr';\n\nimport fetcher from '../../lib/fetcher';\nimport Track from '@components/Track';\n\nexport default function NowPlaying() {\n  const { data, error } = useSWR('/api/last-played',\n    fetcher, {\n      refreshInterval: 18000,\n      revalidateOnReconnect: true,\n      revalidateOnFocus: true,\n      focusThrottleInterval: 9000\n  });\n\n  if (!data) return <div>Loading...</div>;\n  if (error) return <div>Something went terribly wrong...</div>;\n\n  return data ? <Track track={data} /> : null\n```\n\nHere I request that SWR refetches new data regularly, refetches it on focus (if a user scrolles away from the Now Playing component, or switches to a different tab and comes back), and refetches data on reconnect (if the user's connection is lost, and reconnects).\n\nThe `fetcher` function is a simple wrapper around `fetch` that returns a promise:\n\n```typescript\nexport default async function Fetcher(...args) {\n  const res = await fetch(...args);\n\n  return res.json();\n}\n```\n\nI pass the `data` to the Track component for rendering:\n\n```typescript\nimport Image from \"next/image\";\nimport { shimmer, toBase64 } from \"./Utils/MDXComponents\";\n\nexport default function Track({track}) {\n  return (\n    <div className=\"flex flex-row max-w-3xl pl-2 pt-1 mt-8\">\n      <div>\n      // This is wonky. Since Next.js Static Image\n      // component doesn't support static imports\n      // of remote images (duh), I have to use a workaround\n      // for blur placeholder. It's a simple shimmer that\n      // takes exact space of an image white it's lazy-loading\n        <Image className=\"w-full\" width=\"50\" height=\"50\"\n        src={track.albumImageUrl} placeholder=\"blur\"\n        blurDataURL={`data:image/svg+xml;base64,\n        ${toBase64(shimmer(50, 50))}`} alt={track.title}\n        layout=\"intrinsic\" />\n        </div>\n      <div className=\"flex flex-col pl-5\">\n        <a\n          className=\"font-medium xl:w-96 text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-100 truncate sm:w-96 md:w-full\"\n          href={track.songUrl}\n          target=\"_blank\"\n          rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\n        >\n          {track.title}\n        </a>\n        <p\n          className=\"text-gray-500 mb-4 truncate w-60 sm:w-96 md:w-full\"\n          color=\"gray.500\"\n        >\n          {track.artist}\n        </p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```\n\nThat's about it. The result looks like this:\n\nThat's about it. Oh, I've also went ahead and spun up a repo for this specific thing, feel free to check it out: [current-apple-music](https://github.com/rosnovsky/current-apple-music). This one generates an image of the current song playing on Apple Music that you can use in your website or in your Github profile's README ;)","src/content/blog/2021/11/01/apple-music.md",[35],"80a79bd075483c32",{html:1933,metadata:1934},"<blockquote>\n<p>This whole thing requires that you have an active paid Apple Developer account.

I missed live music so much that as soon as I got a chance to go to concerts again, I went nuts.",["Date","2021-09-11T00:00:00.000Z"],"In a normal year, my wife and I would go to 5-10 live concerts. Not only it's something that we love and do, but also something that we can hardly live without. It's not a huge streatch to say that last year sucked in this regard. I recognize that we are very fortunate to have \"live concerts\" as one of the biggest dissapointments of 2020.\n\nAnyway, as vaccination rates soared in Washington state in general and in our counties in particular, many restrictions on public events were lifted. Now sitting at about 80% of the population fully vaccinated, it seemed like as good time as any to get back to live music (and other events, eventually).\n\nAs soon as I got a chance, I got tickets to a few concerts; In a way, I overcorrected for the entire year without live music, and got tickets to four shows happening in a span of a month. Two down, two more to go.\n\n## Hella Mega Tour\n\nGreen Day is one of my all-time favorite bands. \"Wake Me Up When September Ends\" is one of my all-time favorite songs. Fall Out Boy is one of my other all-time favorites. Naturally, they were on a must-see list for a while, but circumstances were never in my favor. Until this September.\n\nHella Mega Tour was supposed to stop by in Seattle in July 2020. Obviously, it was postponed and later rescheduled, and until the very day of the show, I wasn't sure it won't be postponed again (with Delta variant and all).\n\nThe show opened with Weezer set. I'm not a fan, but there are a couple of songs that I like.\n\n![Weezer](assets/blog/posts/concerts-sep21/concerts0001.jpeg)\n![Weezer](assets/blog/posts/concerts-sep21/concerts0004.jpeg)\n![Weezer](assets/blog/posts/concerts-sep21/concerts0006.jpeg)\n![Weezer](assets/blog/posts/concerts-sep21/concerts0007.jpeg)\n\n## Fall Out Boy\n\nFall Out Boy is a different story. We've seen them in concert in 2018, and it was awesome. I really like that not only they're good at music but they also stand for what's right.\n\n![Fall Out Boy](assets/blog/posts/concerts-sep21/6E043EFE-823F-4CC1-AAB7-BC1A889FF475_1_105_c.jpeg)\n\nLast time, I was a little bit surprised by how the band sounded at Key Arena. The sound was a bit weird, somewhat off. I've written it off as a poor seats issue: our seats were to the side of the stage and quite far from it, so it's possible that the sound wasn't off and it were our seats to blame.\n\nI guess I was wrong. The difference is sound between the 2018 concert and this one was so drastic that it's evident: last time the sound was off indeed.\n\n![Fall Out Boy](assets/blog/posts/concerts-sep21/concerts0021.jpeg)\n\n![Fall Out Boy](assets/blog/posts/concerts-sep21/concerts0019.jpeg)\n\nNot sure if this fact is interesting, but when I illegally acquired an iTunes account in 2008 (I was in Russia back then, and iTunes didn't work there), the first album I bought was FOB's \"Infinity on High\". The second one was \"All-American Rejects\", but they are out of scope for this post.\n\n![Fall Out Boy](assets/blog/posts/concerts-sep21/concerts0023.jpeg)\n![Fall Out Boy](assets/blog/posts/concerts-sep21/concerts0024.jpeg)\n![Fall Out Boy](assets/blog/posts/concerts-sep21/concerts0025.jpeg)\n\n## Green Day\n\nFinally, Green Day. It's safe to say that they are my favorite band right now. I missed their show in Seattle in 2018 and this time I was set on actually making it to see them in concert.\n\n![Green Day](assets/blog/posts/concerts-sep21/concerts0027.jpeg)\n![Green Day](assets/blog/posts/concerts-sep21/concerts0028.jpeg)\n![Green Day](assets/blog/posts/concerts-sep21/CAC97862-40A9-456B-B9AC-45398C01B81C_1_102_a.jpeg)\n![Green Day](assets/blog/posts/concerts-sep21/06CAFCA6-07B9-4C65-BD97-EC7790066A93_1_102_a.jpeg)\n![Green Day](assets/blog/posts/concerts-sep21/concerts0029.jpeg)\n\n## Lindsey Stirling\n\nLindsey Stirling holds a special place in my heart.

Not only it’s something that we love and do, but also something that we can hardly live without. It’s not a huge streatch to say that last year sucked in this regard. I recognize that we are very fortunate to have “live concerts” as one of the biggest dissapointments of 2020.</p>\n<p>Anyway, as vaccination rates soared in Washington state in general and in our counties in particular, many restrictions on public events were lifted. Now sitting at about 80% of the population fully vaccinated, it seemed like as good time as any to get back to live music (and other events, eventually).</p>\n<p>As soon as I got a chance, I got tickets to a few concerts; In a way, I overcorrected for the entire year without live music, and got tickets to four shows happening in a span of a month. Two down, two more to go.</p>\n<h2 id=\"hella-mega-tour\">Hella Mega Tour</h2>\n<p>Green Day is one of my all-time favorite bands. “Wake Me Up When September Ends” is one of my all-time favorite songs. Fall Out Boy is one of my other all-time favorites. Naturally, they were on a must-see list for a while, but circumstances were never in my favor. Until this September.</p>\n<p>Hella Mega Tour was supposed to stop by in Seattle in July 2020. Obviously, it was postponed and later rescheduled, and until the very day of the show, I wasn’t sure it won’t be postponed again (with Delta variant and all).</p>\n<p>The show opened with Weezer set. I’m not a fan, but there are a couple of songs that I like.</p>\n<p><img __ASTRO_IMAGE_=\"{&#x22;src&#x22;:&#x22;assets/blog/posts/concerts-sep21/concerts0001.jpeg&#x22;,&#x22;alt&#x22;:&#x22;Weezer&#x22;,&#x22;index&#x22;:0}\">\n<img __ASTRO_IMAGE_=\"{&#x22;src&#x22;:&#x22;assets/blog/posts/concerts-sep21/concerts0004.jpeg&#x22;,&#x22;alt&#x22;:&#x22;Weezer&#x22;,&#x22;index&#x22;:0}\">\n<img __ASTRO_IMAGE_=\"{&#x22;src&#x22;:&#x22;assets/blog/posts/concerts-sep21/concerts0006.jpeg&#x22;,&#x22;alt&#x22;:&#x22;Weezer&#x22;,&#x22;index&#x22;:0}\">\n<img __ASTRO_IMAGE_=\"{&#x22;src&#x22;:&#x22;assets/blog/posts/concerts-sep21/concerts0007.jpeg&#x22;,&#x22;alt&#x22;:&#x22;Weezer&#x22;,&#x22;index&#x22;:0}\"></p>\n<h2 id=\"fall-out-boy\">Fall Out Boy</h2>\n<p>Fall Out Boy is a different story.

You know, \"Zukerberg is a quadrillionaire, and what have you acheieved?!\" kind of thing.\n\nFirst, the best way to be permanently unhappy is to compare yourself to others. Not gonna happen; it only makes sense to compare yourself to yourself _yesterday_.\n\nSecond, I'm doing fine. I've got my family, a place to live (and call [my own](/blog/june-2021-update) at that!), a job I like, and a bunch of hobbies. I have my books, my [journals](/blog/journaling), and a firepit in my backyard. I do my little things trying to make the world a better place even if in a small way.\n\n![](assets/blog/posts/old-man-yells-at-cloud/hitfm.jpg)\n\n![](assets/blog/posts/old-man-yells-at-cloud/mayak.jpg)\n\nI was born in the Soviet Union, lived most of my adult life in Russia, moved to Canada, then to the U.S., and made it here too. In total, I've moved ~13 times since turning 18 (including 2 immigrations). I've made some friends along the way, and only a few enemies.\n\n![](assets/blog/posts/old-man-yells-at-cloud/landed-canada.jpg)\n![](assets/blog/posts/old-man-yells-at-cloud/landed.jpg)\n\nI almost got my private pilot license (and I still may get it at some point). I [hiked around a volcano](/blog/loowit-trail), piloted an airplane over the Hoover Dam, joined, started and failed a few businesses, and had a podcast for over 14 years. I helped a few good people meet each other, and I'm mostly proud of folks in my close circle.\n\nI'd worked as a paper delivery carrier, a reporter (and a frontline one at that), an editor of a magazine, radio host, editor, producer, DJ; I'd been a college student in my 30s and the oldest person in my class. I'd been unemployed, been a landlord, a contractor at three different _Fortune 50_ companies, and a full-time software engineer.\n\n![](assets/blog/posts/old-man-yells-at-cloud/intel.jpg)\n![](assets/blog/posts/old-man-yells-at-cloud/att.jpg)\n![](assets/blog/posts/old-man-yells-at-cloud/microsoft.jpg)\n\nMost importantly, I'm not embarrased by how I live my life. I stand with those less privileged and less fortunate than me. I think I'm on the side of justice more often than not, and I'm not afraid of the future generations' eventual scrutiny of my life. I try to live my life honestly, give back whenever I can, and I'm convinced that this is a big part of why I'm so organically comfortable with myself. I've got a head full of gray hair, and I'm going bald, and it's ok with me :)\n\nHere's to the next 40 years!\n\n![](assets/blog/posts/old-man-yells-at-cloud/mugshot.jpg)\n\nP.S. Obligatory \"get off my lawn, you darn kids\"! Going to buy a Harley, a leather jacket and suspenders, and join other old farts in bitching about the good old days. Just watch me! :))\n\nP.P.S. As a \"class of '99\" person, I shoud've really used more sunscreen :)\n\n<YouTube id=\"sTJ7AzBIJoI\" className=\"mx-auto min-w-full\" />","src/content/blog/2022/01/28/old-man-yells-at-cloud.mdx",[2077],"@assets/blog/posts/old-man-yells-at-cloud/old.jpg","3bd4b963337fe8ff","2022/01/28/old-man-yells-at-cloud.mdx","2021/12/28/2021",{id:2080,data:2082,body:2088,filePath:2089,assetImports:2090,digest:2095,rendered:2096,legacyId:2131},{title:2083,image:2084,category:74,description:2086,publishDate:2087},"2021: The Year in Review",{src:2085,alt:23},"__ASTRO_IMAGE_@assets/blog/posts/2021/IMG_0743.jpeg","2021 was a very long year.

Hundreds of thousands of people died of COVID-19, albeit most of them deliberately unvaccinated. People kept struggling to get their jobs back, and the economy was still in a state of flux. It's important to remember that the economy is not the stock market, and that the stock market is not the economy (and not even necessarily _reflective_ or the economy). The struggle is real, and it's much more real for those essential for the actual economy. With this being said, the labor shortage got some bargaining power in the hands of the working class, which is without a doubt a great thing.\n\nFor my family the pandemic kept affecting our plans, specifically, our plans of getting together. With embassies closed or working at limited capacity and with other government agencies significantly underperforming, a lot of our long-term plans were (and still are) in jeopardy.\n\nPersonally, I'm extremely privileged and lucky to be in a position of not being affected by the pandemic. I work from home at a company that [gives a shit](/blog/how-to-give-a-shit) about me (not personally, but as an employee). When [Auth0](https://auth0.com) was acquired by [Okta](https://okta.com) in the spring of this year, it benefited me a lot. Financially, it was a good year for me as well. So much so that I've got to buy a house.\n\n## We bought a house\n\nThis is probably the biggest event of the year for me. In early January, I sold my rental house in Georgia (with a written provision in the contract that my tenants will be able to remain in the house and their rent will not change for at least another year), and with some financial luck that followed the acquisition of Auth0, I was able to come up with about 10%-worth of downpayment and buy a house for us here in Arlington, WA. It's not a dream house by any stretch of imagination, but it's _our_ house and we're turning it into a _home_.\n\n![](assets/blog/posts/2021/IMG_0743.jpeg)\n\n## Work got... interesting\n\nWork was, well, interesting this year. I've accepted another role within the company, but it turned out to be a complicated affair. I got to work on a new process and a new team, which was pretty awesome. However, a lot of my initial assumptions and working theories were wrong, and by the end of the year our team shifted from its initial purpose to a new one. I'm building a net-new product, and as much as I love coding, its success is still an open question. On the bright side, I learn a lot and my team is pretty great.\n\n## What I learned\n\n- TypeScript and scaffolding and building new products\n- Creating two open-source projects that hundreds of people use every day was fun (check out [Sanity Autocomplete Tags](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sanity-plugin-autocomplete-tags) and [Current Apple Music](https://github.com/rosnovsky/current-apple-music))\n- Family is everything\n- It's possible to improve one's mental health by prioritizing it over work\n- Analog is the shit: I [journal](/blog/journaling), take notes, plan on paper, and it's been a smashing success\n\n## Win of the Year\n\nA family member landed in the US as a permanent resident, and, well, buying a house.\n\n## Fail of the Year\n\nMy failure to recognize mental health warning signs in time, and my inability to act decisively to get to work on things I want to work on.\n\n## What I'm looking forward to in 2022\n\nMy expectations for 2022 are really, _really_ low. I hope to rectify this year's failures, keep working on my mental health, rest _way more_ than I'm used to, and hopefully travel a bit more. I also hope to attend a few conferences and give a talk at one of them :) I mean, reach for the stars, am I right?!\n\n### Previously\n\n- [2020: The Year in Review](/blog/2020-you-won-t-be-missed)","src/content/blog/2021/12/28/2021.md",[2091,2092,2093,2094],"assets/blog/posts/2021/Leah-Millis-Capitol-Insurrection-2021-01-06T221849Z_398565167_RC2M2L9MWY3E_RTRMADP_3_USA-ELECTION-TRUMP.jpg.webp","assets/blog/posts/2021/Main_Logo_Square_Large.png","assets/blog/posts/2021/IMG_0743.jpeg","@assets/blog/posts/2021/IMG_0743.jpeg","334552e03036df6e",{html:2097,metadata:2098},"<p>2021 was a very long year.

It took me almost three years to make it happen: we began serious preparation immediately after Russia invaded Georgia in August 2008. I want to talk about it.\n\nI was about nine years old when the USSR collapsed, so it's fair to say that I've witnessed the final breaths of the decaying empire.\n\nI remember quite a bit from that time. While my memory is pretty spotty at best, some things stand out decades later.\n\nI remember seeing intercity bus sanitation check-points along the highway leading to Moscow from Ukraine in 1986/87. I remember staying inside at my kindergarten after it rained around the same time. A dude in a hazmat suit walked outside with a radiation detector.\n\n![In Crimea with my father, circa 1988](assets/blog/posts/everyting-will-be-ukraine/a4032fe15f3f1f1c27a7b5f04ec5bcdcd08f4331-948x1121.avif)\n\nI remember food cards and hours-long lines for food. I remember when mom sent me to a store to buy something, like, milk or bread - something necessary, but I decided that some jam was in order; after all, we hadn't had jam for a while. I didn't realize how huge of a blow this was back then.\n\nI remember representing Georgia in a kindergarten play, dancing [lezginka](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lezginka) in traditional Georgian clothes.\n\nI remember watching tanks rolling along the highway towards Moscow in August 1991 during the [August coup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1991_Soviet_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat_attempt). I remember family hunkering down at our dacha near Moscow.\n\nI remember our first exchange guest, an American from Atlanta, staying at our apartment for a few weeks in 1992.\n\n![\"Unknown Soldier\" memorial by the Kremlin. Moscow, 1992.](assets/blog/posts/everyting-will-be-ukraine/dd0d5feb5ff50f79399f5dad053daaff02e27982-1764x1164.avif)\n\nI clearly remember American humanitarian aid — from milk and multivitamins to pens and t-shirts. We didn't have much at the time, and what little we had was way too expensive, so this aid was badly needed and much appreciated.\n\nI remember our second American guests, who arrived right after the House of the Government (Russian \"White House\") was shelled by tanks and set on fire during the [1993 constitutional crisis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1993_Russian_constitutional_crisis).\n\nI remember going to the \"Kyiv Market,\" a make-shift outdoor market near Kyivskaya metro station, for cheap expired food. Folks would sell food past its \"best before\" date or about to expire. It was more affordable this way.\n\nI remember my parents' attempts at business and how difficult it was for them to make ends meet. I understand it now, but back then, I was little, barely a teenager, and I didn't really see or understand _their_ struggles.\n\nI remember my first i386 personal computer, a powerful Intel 486 machine running at 90 Mhz, with 16 Mb of RAM and a huge 800 Mb hard drive. It was $800 in 1995 money in Russia, which is, like, $5000 in today's money. I thought that it was cool of my parents to buy it, but I didn't realize exactly how cool it was.\n\nI remember going to the U.S. for two months in the summer of 1996 and staying with a family in Ephrata, WA. I remember meeting with our first American guest (the one from Atlanta) in Seattle and later going on a road trip from Seattle to Tijuana, Mexico. I was offered to stay in Central Washington for the next school year but ultimately declined, and I'll explain why in a moment.\n\n![Me on Bainbridge Island ferry in Seattle, 1996](assets/blog/posts/everyting-will-be-ukraine/7da1365b7086ac44034af168b88a6b6fe8ececa0-1436x1034.avif)\n\n![Me in Seattle, 1996](assets/blog/posts/everyting-will-be-ukraine/0fedb0e82c86723a9da41fb2cc983022b94fecdc-1776x1168.avif)\n\nI remember going to Bulgaria a couple of times. I don't think we could afford any other kind of vacation, but it was always a treat going there.\n\nBut most of all, throughout this entire time, I remember the feeling of the whole world being open to us. A sense that our country is joining other nations, at long last, in becoming civilized, free, and democratic. And I was one of the \"next generation\" kids who expected to carry out this transformation.\n\n![Russia's first McDonalds (now closed), c. 1991](assets/blog/posts/everyting-will-be-ukraine/e78ec686c356fb19fde4fdd9e70175cd9d13b837-1433x971.avif)\n\nWe studied the Constitution at school and debated how different freedoms work and how they should be reflected in the country's daily life. I admired the work of journalists who upheld these freedoms and decided to become one. I really, really wanted to live in a free and democratic country. I believe that I can and should help Russia shed its ugly past and be the best place it possibly could be. That is why I declined to spend a year in Washington: I was a patriot of my young homeland.\n\n![From Newseum.](assets/blog/posts/everyting-will-be-ukraine/525cc23c73f8122fe0b9c5f1e3ba9d5d1d262db2-2048x1536.avif)\n\nAnd then it all came crashing down.\n\nThe arrest of Khodorkovsky, dismantling of first NTV, then TV6, then slowly but steadily every other free news media. I remember the slow hijacking of the narrative about the West.

Russia's pathetic dictator invaded Ukraine. He's bombing and shelling beautiful, peaceful cities and khutors, killing thousands of civilians. And while his army is the second-best army in Ukraine and has failed to reach any of its objectives so far, it doesn't change the fact that there's a real fucking war going on in Ukraine. My country of birth is the aggressor.\n\nTo be clear, I feel no allegiance to Russia whatsoever. I was born in its evil predecessor, lived for 20 years in \"independent\" Russia, and left it for good 10+ years ago; that's about it. I consider myself an American (a Russian-American before February 24, 2022). And the more I learn about Russian history and Russian imperialism, the more appalled I am by how I used to see this country and its people as redeemable, how I thought about Ukraine as Russia's \"little brother\" and about Ukrainians as kind, quirky, and sweet \"brotherly\" folk. I mean, they are kind and sweet. It's just that Russia was never a \"big brother\" to Ukraine and Ukrainians but rather a violent, constantly drunk, abusive foster parent. And for this, there's no forgiveness for me and all of us.\n\nThis long-ass intro is important for setting some context.\n\nNow, Ukraine. Somehow, it just so happened that many, if not most of my friends, are Ukrainians. Ukrainian-Canadians, Ukrainian-Americans, just Ukrainians. I've been to Kyiv a few times, drove there from Moscow once, and I sincerely fell in love with the city, the people, and the country. And it almost physically pains me to think that someone, anyone, would wage actual war against Ukraine. It's unthinkable, unspeakable, yet here we are. And 100% of my sympathy and support is with Ukraine, with no reservations. Смерть ворогам!\n\n![Outside of Kyiv Borispil International Airport.

I want to see it destroyed, utterly and completely. I'd be a little sad to see Kremlin in ruins, but I'd be totally fine with it. I want to see Russia [denazified](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denazification) and deputinified as the Allies did in Germany after WWII. I sincerely hope that the entire Russian project is dismantled and broken into smaller countries so that people in those countries could literally break up with the Russian imperialist past. I wish that every Russian soldier who enters Ukraine returns home in a body bag. I swear I'll have the biggest celebration when P\\*tin dies a painful and gruesome death — it will be a great day for Eastern Europe and the world.\n\nAnd you know what? All of this is going to happen. Mark my words, this war is the end of Russia, and it's wonderful. The world needs fewer russias and more ukraines. And as with every major war between good and evil, between right and wrong, the good will win. Ukraine will win.

I mean, they are kind and sweet. It’s just that Russia was never a “big brother” to Ukraine and Ukrainians but rather a violent, constantly drunk, abusive foster parent. And for this, there’s no forgiveness for me and all of us.</p>\n<p>This long-ass intro is important for setting some context.</p>\n<p>Now, Ukraine. Somehow, it just so happened that many, if not most of my friends, are Ukrainians. Ukrainian-Canadians, Ukrainian-Americans, just Ukrainians. I’ve been to Kyiv a few times, drove there from Moscow once, and I sincerely fell in love with the city, the people, and the country. And it almost physically pains me to think that someone, anyone, would wage actual war against Ukraine. It’s unthinkable, unspeakable, yet here we are. And 100% of my sympathy and support is with Ukraine, with no reservations.

I want to see it destroyed, utterly and completely. I’d be a little sad to see Kremlin in ruins, but I’d be totally fine with it. I want to see Russia <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denazification\">denazified</a> and deputinified as the Allies did in Germany after WWII. I sincerely hope that the entire Russian project is dismantled and broken into smaller countries so that people in those countries could literally break up with the Russian imperialist past. I wish that every Russian soldier who enters Ukraine returns home in a body bag. I swear I’ll have the biggest celebration when P*tin dies a painful and gruesome death — it will be a great day for Eastern Europe and the world.</p>\n<p>And you know what? All of this is going to happen. Mark my words, this war is the end of Russia, and it’s wonderful. The world needs fewer russias and more ukraines.

Well, one of the most compelling ones, at least for my taste, is turning a lawn into a meadow.\n\nMeadows are awesome. They look beautiful and natural, they attract bees, humming birds, and all sorts of wildlife. When replacing a lawn, meadows reclaim and return bits of natural habitats to hundreds of local species.

Normally, we'd stay there whenever we take a ferry to Victoria, BC, but this time around we just went there to camp.\n\nAs a side note, I really want to point out that I don't like [KOA](https://koa.com/) campgrounds. Like, I hate them, really. They don't get tent camping at all, they are the opposite of camping in general, and in fact, they are just parking lots with RV hookups and a few spaces to pitch a few tents wall-to-wall on the margins. We go there for one reason and one reason only: they are available when we make our camping plans.

Aside from being atrocious in itself (a military invasion of a major European country) and brutally devastating to an entirely friendly nation of Ukraine, this war will shape the world in the next decade or so. Since Russia cannot win this war even theoretically, its imminent fall will ripple across the world, perhaps, on the scale not seen since the collapse of the Soviet Union.\n\nAnd while the global implications of the war are important and all, it's hard to overlook more immediate and personal effects it has on people. A peaceful country of Ukraine being shelled by the Russians affects very real people in very real ways. Quite a few of these people I know personally, some of them are friends. With this said, most of my family is in Russia; some friends are still in Russia, although a lot of them are now scattered around the world. And while it's easy for me to side with Ukrainians against the invaders, ties to the \"invaders\" don't help with peace of mind and make this war somewhat more complicated to process. I'm not complaining, mind you, just want to acknowledge this. What did German-born Americans with a lot of Jewish and Eastern European friends feel in the late 1930s? I think, I know.\n\nAll in all, fuck Putin, fuck Russia, Glory to Ukraine.\n\n![image](assets/blog/posts/2022-a-year-in-review/concert.jpg)\n\nWhile nothing of importance happened in 2022 compared to the war, for posterity's sake here are some other notable events of this shit-pile of a year.\n\n## Professional Growth\n\nThis year I leaped from where I was 3 years ago to where I wanted to eventually get. I joined Auth0 as Developer Support Engineer in 2019, and all of 2022 I'd been working as a Software Engineer. I mean, I've been doing web development for a while, but somehow this feels different.\n\nIt also feels different because of the high standards expected from engineers which I didn't have to adhere in my past positions: usually, I was the one establishing standards for myself, which is no way to grow. This year I got to experience a level of growth and learning I haven't experienced ever before.\n\nFunny enough, I struggled a lot. Like, A LOT. It was tricky to get the exact way the team I'm working with communicates, how problems and roadblocks are being dealt with, what exactly are the expectations, and so forth. So far, it all worked out pretty good.\n\nI also want to acknowledge with gratitude that I've got a lot of help, mentorship, and guidance from more senior colleagues, and would've been struggling still if it wasn't for this help.\n\n## Apathy and hopelessness\n\nI'm not entirely sure where this comes from, but this year I realized that I don't really have any hope for the future. It didn't happen this year, the hopelessness I mean, but I just realized what this nagging feeling was at the back of my mind whenever I reached out for a future I want, expect, or hope for.\n\nI don't think humanity can get its shit together to avert or even just soften imminent climate catastrophe. The \"global south\" will never get justice it deserves. There will be no giving land back and no reparations. Money will keep ruining everything it touches. The rich will keep getting ever more obscenely rich, and the poor will keep getting poorer, struggle, get more sick, and die young. Fascism resurgence is here to stay. All of it sucks.\n\nPersonally, I just hope to not die soon, and try and survive until I can tap into my Social Security (given that it's still a thing 20 years from now which is not guaranteed). I don't really see my future. Where will I be 10 years form now? Where do I want to be 10 years from now? I just hope to be alive, have my family around, all healthy and happy, have a roof over my head and food in the fridge. A dog would be nice.\n\nFeels like a low bar.\n\n## Death of Twitter, Rise of Mastodon\n\nI've been using Twitter since 2007. In recent years, it became the last and only one social network I kept using; I'm not on Facebook, not on Instagram, not on TikTok, not on Telegram, you name it - I'm not on it. This year, though, Twitter died. Not just for me, mind you. It made me really sad but also hopeful for the new rising network that is built in a way that safeguards it from everything that happened to and with Twitter. Starting your social network over from scratch in your forties is tricky but also easier in some ways. It's easier to cut through bullshit. It's easier to be more particular about the company you keep. It's easier to walk away when something doesn't spark joy.\n\nIn the wake of Twitter takeover by a petulant idiot man-baby, Mastodon (or more precisely, ActivityPub protocol) got a huge boost. I toyed with Mastodon in 2019 running my own single-user instance, and it was fine. This time around it's not just fine, it's actually fun, exciting, and beautiful. And this time around, I'm running an actual public instance called [Lounge Town](https://lounge.town). Feel free to join it, as of this writing there're about 170 active users with another almost 9 million all over the Fediverse. Chances are, some of your friends are there already, and some of the high profile people you used to follow elsewhere are there too. I'm so very happy to see Mastodon (and broader ActivityPub) go mainstream. I have no idea why anyone would ever go back to a corporate-owned walled garden social media site.\n\n## Goals hits and misses\n\nEvery year I set goals for myself, and every year at the end of December I review these goals. I mean, I look at them every day of the year and they guide my efforts, but in December I tally the results.\n\nOut of 7 goals I've set for myself, I've hit three and kinda sorta hit two more. Which is not terribly bad. There's a lot of room for improvement, though. I still want to speak at a conference, and I still want to release a great free OTP app for iOS (with iCloud sync, no lock-in, etc). So these two just roll over to 2023.\n\nOut of 6 guiding principals (or focus areas) for the year, I confidently maintained four. Again, not too bad, yet could be better. I failed completely \"Time Outdoors\": weather and general apathy ruined this hiking season, although we managed to squeeze some quality outdoors time, including one awesome vacation. I'm pretty happy with all the principles so I'm keeping them for 2023, probably adding a couple new ones.\n\n## Best buy: Steam Deck\n\nI have to note this. I'm so very impressed with the device, with games that available for it, with pretty much everything surrounding it. I played a lot more this year than ever before, and I played way, way more different games than ever before. I think I get gaming, at last. My favorite games were in no particular order: \"Horizon: Zero Dawn\", \"Detroit: Become Human\", \"Kena: Bridge of Spirits\", \"Life is Strange\" and \"Life is Strange: Before the Storm\", \"Superhot\", and \"Deep Rock Galactic\" (which I mostly play with my son). An honorary mention goes to \"Cities: Skylines\" which I've been playing for years now and can't get enough of. I guess, I am what I play :)\n\n### Best Buy, Honorary Mention: The Beast\n\nThis year I've build myself a computer. It features top of the line AMD Razen 9, Sapphire Nitro+ Radeon 6950, 64 GB of RAM, NXT N7 motherboard and is enclosed in a glass case. Indeed, it's a beast of a machine. Also, it's worth mentioning that I personally don't use any systems aside from Linux ones. I still do have a 2013 iMac which is collecting dust on a table outside of my office, but I haven't used it in years. If for some reason you're interested in what else I use, I've got a page for that!\n\n### What I'm looking forward to in 2023\n\nI never thought that my expectations could get any lower than the ones I had for 2021 and 2022 yet here we are.\n\n- If Russia loses its stupid war with Ukraine and finally implodes, I'd be very happy.\n- If we all manage to survive 2023 and gather a year from now for another installment of \"Year in Review\", I'd be very happy.\n- If no (new) major global fuckups happen, no (new) major disasters, no (new) major devastation, I'd be very happy.\n\nI mean, I realize it's a lot to ask but at the same time, could the bar be any lower?..","src/content/blog/2022/12/31/2022-a-year-in-review.md",[2544,2545],"assets/blog/posts/2022-a-year-in-review/concert.jpg","@assets/blog/posts/2022-a-year-in-review/concert.jpg","2ccdfdbc97849b82",{html:2548,metadata:2549},"<h2 id=\"war-in-ukraine\">War in Ukraine</h2>\n<p>Without any doubt, the most important development of 2022 was Russian invasion and full-scale war in Ukraine.

Here's how (and why).",["Date","2023-12-02T20:59:00.000Z"],"It's been quite a journey. For the longest time, I used [Vercel](https://vercel.com) with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) for this blog. I've re-written bits and pieces of it through the years, added and removed features, deployed and redeployed it many times.\n\n## Rewrite it in Astro\n\nRecently, I've been toying with [Astro](https://astro.build). It feels a better fit for a static blog with just a handful of dynamic features. A blog is static by definition, yet I used to have a few dynamic things around here:\n\n- **Search**: a dynamic search, with instant results dropdown powered by [Algolia](https://algolia.com)\n- **Comments**: an auto-refresh comment system powered by [Sanity](https://sanity.io)\n- **Status**: a live indicator of the status of the site and its various APIs\n- **COVID stats**: live count of COVID cases, hospitalizations, and deaths\n- **Live stats**: a bunch of different stats displayed (visitors, newsletter subscribers, github stars, etc)\n\nI bet I'm forgetting something, but the bottom line is that most of the site is static, and `Next.js` is in facta bit of an overkill.\n\nSo some time ago I started migrationg the blog to `Astro`, a framework that's more suitable for sites with little interactivity. It's still possible to have `islands` that behave dynamically, it's even possible to use other frameworks with Astro (I'm using `React`), but it remains focused on building a fast, static, mostly HTML pages. Perfect for what I've got here.\n\n## Move off of Vercel\n\nThe next thing I wanted to do is to move off of Vercel. I've been hosting stuff on Vercel since before it was called Vercel, and I love it. It's a cool company full of cool people working on cool tech. However, there are a few concerning trends I've been noticing lately:\n\n- `Next.js` gets tighter and tighter shaped by Vercel's hosting\n- the simplicity of `Next.js` suffers in favor of enterprise features\n- Vercel is more focused on enterprise customers than ever before\n\nAnd than there's the inevitable [enshittification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enshittification) that is coming whether we like it or not. I have a strong feeling that as time goes by, Next.js itself or at least its more advanced and interesting features will be tied to Vercel hosting, which in turn will offer fewer features for free and cater more and more towards enterprise customers. And the features that are more developer-friendly will be more and more expensive (take their DB solutions, for example). Don't get me wrong, all power to them, they are a for-profit corporation and the whole reason they exist is to make more and more money. It's just it doesn't align with anything I need or want.\n\n## Self-host it\n\nSo, here I am, thinking to myself \"how and where can I host this blog?\" I was working with `Kubernetes` at work when it hit me: I can move many things I rent from other companies to my own `k8s` cluster. Will it be cheaper? Absolutely not; after all, I'm taking features that are offered for free or are cheap at the moment due to chep VC money, and _roll my own_ paying with my own money. But if the last 10-15 years on the Internet taught me anything it's that if I'm not paying for it with my own money, I'm the product or I pay for it in other ways. And I hate that it's this way.\n\nI've done a bit of research and came to a conclusion that, in fact, I'd be better off hosting my own stuff even if I have to pay more for it. Here's the plan I came up with.\n\nI've got a bunch of things I rely on for my side projects, learning, and just messing around with different technologies:\n\n- Postgres databases\n- S3-like storage\n- web hosting\n- CI/CD pipelines that autodeploy my stuff\n- Algolia-powered search\n- Sanity.io-powered CMS\n- other things that I'm forgetting\n\nRolling these things myself sounds like a challenge, and it certainly is. But it's also rewarding to know that I _own_ this stuff to a greater extent than before.\n\n## Kuberbetes it is, then\n\nI've got myself a cluster at [Civo](https://civo.com) with 2 Large nodes and got to work. The easy part was to deploy web apps there: you just add a `Dockerfile` to the project, push it to a registry (I used Github, DockerHub, and GitLab registries), explain to the cluster how to run them and how to expose them to the internet, run `kubectl apply` and you're done. All of the tricky things happen when you want to get stuff working automagically, say, deploy a new version of this site whenever you merge a PR to `main`, or automatically index every post upon deployment.\n\nThis is where educational benefits come in. I learned how to build and push `Docker` images in different CI environemnts, how to work with different registries, how to ensure that internal networking actually does what I want it to do, and how to take any `Docker` file and turn it into a service running in my cluster. It was fun, and not that difficult.\n\n## Current status of things\n\nAs it stand right now, this site is deployed automatically whenever I merge a PR to its `main` branch. Github Action builds the site itself, builds a `Docker` image, pushes it to a registry and bounces the Kubernetes `deployment`. So within a few minutes of the merge, and updated site is up and running.\n\nThere's still more to do.\n\nI do have [TypeSense](https://typesense.org) running but I'm not indexing blog posts yet. Authentication is not implemented yet (and I'm going to try and run [Logto](https://logto.io) for it), there're no comments implemented (but a fully configured Postgres DB is running in the cluster, ready to accept and store those comments). The CMS is no longer something I want to deal with so it's just `mdx` files now (again).\n\nAll in all, it's going pretty good and the end result is in sight.\n\n---\n\n**UPDATE**: A few days after posting this, I had shut down my Civo cluster and moved to a VPS by [Hostinger](https://hostinger.com?REFERRALCODE=1ART641) (referal link, 20% off). I installed `Debian` and `k3s` there, and that's where my cluster is hosted now.\n\n---","src/content/blog/2023/12/02/vercel-to-kubernetes.md",[35],"d432abd958e1eb36",{html:2592,metadata:2593},"<p>It’s been quite a journey.

However, there are a few concerning trends I’ve been noticing lately:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>Next.js</code> gets tighter and tighter shaped by Vercel’s hosting</li>\n<li>the simplicity of <code>Next.js</code> suffers in favor of enterprise features</li>\n<li>Vercel is more focused on enterprise customers than ever before</li>\n</ul>\n<p>And than there’s the inevitable <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enshittification\">enshittification</a> that is coming whether we like it or not. I have a strong feeling that as time goes by, Next.js itself or at least its more advanced and interesting features will be tied to Vercel hosting, which in turn will offer fewer features for free and cater more and more towards enterprise customers. And the features that are more developer-friendly will be more and more expensive (take their DB solutions, for example). Don’t get me wrong, all power to them, they are a for-profit corporation and the whole reason they exist is to make more and more money. It’s just it doesn’t align with anything I need or want.</p>\n<h2 id=\"self-host-it\">Self-host it</h2>\n<p>So, here I am, thinking to myself “how and where can I host this blog?” I was working with <code>Kubernetes</code> at work when it hit me: I can move many things I rent from other companies to my own <code>k8s</code> cluster. Will it be cheaper? Absolutely not; after all, I’m taking features that are offered for free or are cheap at the moment due to chep VC money, and <em>roll my own</em> paying with my own money. But if the last 10-15 years on the Internet taught me anything it’s that if I’m not paying for it with my own money, I’m the product or I pay for it in other ways. And I hate that it’s this way.</p>\n<p>I’ve done a bit of research and came to a conclusion that, in fact, I’d be better off hosting my own stuff even if I have to pay more for it. Here’s the plan I came up with.</p>\n<p>I’ve got a bunch of things I rely on for my side projects, learning, and just messing around with different technologies:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Postgres databases</li>\n<li>S3-like storage</li>\n<li>web hosting</li>\n<li>CI/CD pipelines that autodeploy my stuff</li>\n<li>Algolia-powered search</li>\n<li>Sanity.io-powered CMS</li>\n<li>other things that I’m forgetting</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Rolling these things myself sounds like a challenge, and it certainly is. But it’s also rewarding to know that I <em>own</em> this stuff to a greater extent than before.</p>\n<h2 id=\"kuberbetes-it-is-then\">Kuberbetes it is, then</h2>\n<p>I’ve got myself a cluster at <a href=\"https://civo.com\">Civo</a> with 2 Large nodes and got to work. The easy part was to deploy web apps there: you just add a <code>Dockerfile</code> to the project, push it to a registry (I used Github, DockerHub, and GitLab registries), explain to the cluster how to run them and how to expose them to the internet, run <code>kubectl apply</code> and you’re done. All of the tricky things happen when you want to get stuff working automagically, say, deploy a new version of this site whenever you merge a PR to <code>main</code>, or automatically index every post upon deployment.</p>\n<p>This is where educational benefits come in. I learned how to build and push <code>Docker</code> images in different CI environemnts, how to work with different registries, how to ensure that internal networking actually does what I want it to do, and how to take any <code>Docker</code> file and turn it into a service running in my cluster. It was fun, and not that difficult.</p>\n<h2 id=\"current-status-of-things\">Current status of things</h2>\n<p>As it stand right now, this site is deployed automatically whenever I merge a PR to its <code>main</code> branch. Github Action builds the site itself, builds a <code>Docker</code> image, pushes it to a registry and bounces the Kubernetes <code>deployment</code>. So within a few minutes of the merge, and updated site is up and running.</p>\n<p>There’s still more to do.</p>\n<p>I do have <a href=\"https://typesense.org\">TypeSense</a> running but I’m not indexing blog posts yet. Authentication is not implemented yet (and I’m going to try and run <a href=\"https://logto.io\">Logto</a> for it), there’re no comments implemented (but a fully configured Postgres DB is running in the cluster, ready to accept and store those comments). The CMS is no longer something I want to deal with so it’s just <code>mdx</code> files now (again).</p>\n<p>All in all, it’s going pretty good and the end result is in sight.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: A few days after posting this, I had shut down my Civo cluster and moved to a VPS by <a href=\"https://hostinger.com?REFERRALCODE=1ART641\">Hostinger</a> (referal link, 20% off). I installed <code>Debian</code> and <code>k3s</code> there, and that’s where my cluster is hosted now.</p>\n<hr>",{headings:2594,imagePaths:2610,frontmatter:2611},[2595,2598,2601,2604,2607],{depth:196,slug:2596,text:2597},"rewrite-it-in-astro","Rewrite it in Astro",{depth:196,slug:2599,text:2600},"move-off-of-vercel","Move off of Vercel",{depth:196,slug:2602,text:2603},"self-host-it","Self-host it",{depth:196,slug:2605,text:2606},"kuberbetes-it-is-then","Kuberbetes it is, then",{depth:196,slug:2608,text:2609},"current-status-of-things","Current status of things",[],{title:2583,publishDate:2612,featured:68,category:321,image:2613,description:2585,minutesRead:313},["Date","2023-12-02T20:59:00.000Z"],{src:35,alt:23},"2023/12/02/vercel-to-kubernetes.md","2024/01/16/using-gpt-as-a-rubber-ducky",{id:2615,data:2617,body:2622,filePath:2623,assetImports:2624,digest:2625,rendered:2626,legacyId:2643},{title:2618,image:2619,category:321,description:2620,publishDate:2621},"Using GPT as a rubber ducky",{src:22,alt:23},"There's this popular practice among engineers to talk through problems out loud.

Why not make working with resume updates as convenient as possible?\n\nSo, here's what I came up with when it comes to my _resume workflow_ for this round of job hunting:\n\n- I want an easy way to adjust my resume from anywhere, on any device, in any way I want\n- I want to have full version control for the changes I make\n- I want the system to _automagically_ organize my resume versions across prospective employers\n- I want to have a bit of fun with it, too\n\n## Markdown FTW\n\nMarkdown is great. It's easy to write, it's readable to both humans and machines, it's easy to convert to other formats too, and there are a ton of tools to work with it.\n\nSo let me write my resume in Markdown.\n\n```markdown\n# Art Rosnovsky\n\n## Software Engineer\n\n> job@rosnovsky.us | [github.com/rosnovsky](https://github.com/rosnovsky) | Washington state | **Remote Only** |\n\nDedicated `JavaScript`/`TypeScript` Engineer with a knack for ` React`, `Kubernetes`, and CI/CD. I champion sustainable, ethical tech that makes a positive impact, by building stable, scalable, efficient, and maintainable software.\n\n## Technical Skills\n\n- **Front End**: `JavaScript`, `TypeScript`, `React`, `Svelte`, `Tailwind`, `CSS`, `HTML`\n- **Back End**: `Node.js`, `Express`, `Next.js`, `MongoDB`, `PostgreSQL`, `tRPC`, RESTful APIs\n- **Dev Tools/DevOps**: Git, `Docker`, `Kubernetes`, `Jira`, `AWS`, `Azure`, CI/CD (`GitHub Actions`, `Gitlab Pipelines`)\n- **Other**: former frontline reporter, can fly single-engine aircraft\n\n[... the rest of the resume ...]\n```\n\n## Markdown to PDF\n\n\"_Please attach you resume in Markdown format_\", said no one ever. So I need to convert my resume to PDF. I mean, I need to convert _every edit_ to PDF. I then need to store this _every edit_ in such a way that I won't mix them up and send the wrong one to a potential employer.\n\nThere are many different ways to convert Markdown to PDF. The proper one I should've used is with `pandoc`. But I'm not a proper person, so I went with [md-to-pdf](https://github.com/simonhaenisch/md-to-pdf) package for Node.js: it's just easier to use out-of-the-box.\n\n```typescript\nimport mdToPdf from 'md-to-pdf';\n\nexport const markdownToPdf = async (inputFilePath: string) => {\n  try {\n    const pdf = await mdToPdf({ path: inputFilePath });\n    return pdf;\n  } catch (error: any) {\n    console.error(`Error occurred: ${error.message}`);\n    throw error;\n  }\n};\n```\n\n> If a recruiter asks for a resume in `.docx` or some other exotic/proprietary format, it's a huge red flag. I'll pretend I'm bad at following instructions and send them a PDF anyway.\n\n## Git for version control\n\nNow that I've got my resume in Markdown, converted it to PDF, I need to store it somewhere. Just kidding, it's right there in a folder in the Github repo. I can download the PDF to send it over to someone, or I can just send them a link to the repo (or directly to the `.pdf` file).\n\nI can have branches for every job I'm applying for. I can go back in time to a particular version of the resume that performed better. I can see changes made over time. It's all there, in the repo.\n\n## Fun with it\n\nI'm not doing any of the above by hand. What am I, some caveman?! Github Actions to the rescue! Whenever I push an update to the resume, it triggers a [workflow that converts the resume to PDF](https://github.com/rosnovsky/resume/blob/main/.github/workflows/generate-pdf.yml) and stores it in the repo. It's not perfect (there are quirks preventing me from easily implementing branch protection rules, paths are a bit wonky when it comes to tests, this sort of thing), but it's a start.\n\n```yaml\nname: Generate PDF from resume\n\non:\n  push:\n    paths:\n      # I don't want the workflow to run UNLESS I've updated the actual resume content\n      - 'resume.md'\n  # I want to be able to trigger the workflow manually, if needed\n  workflow_dispatch:\n    inputs:\n      reason:\n        description: 'Re-generate resume PDF'\n        required: false\n        default: 'Manual trigger'\n\npermissions:\n  contents: write\n\njobs:\n  generate-pdf:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n\n    steps:\n      - name: Check out repository\n        uses: actions/checkout@v4\n\n      - name: Set up Node.js\n        uses: actions/setup-node@v4\n        with:\n          node-version: '20.5.0'\n\n      - name: Install dependencies\n        run: npm install -g pnpm && pnpm install\n\n      - name: Generate PDF\n        run: pnpm build\n\n      - name: Commit PDF\n        run: |\n          git config --global user.name \"${{ github.actor }}\"\n          git config --global user.email \"${{ github.actor}}@users.noreply.github.com\"\n          git add output/art_rosnovsky_software_engineer.pdf\n          git commit -am \"feat: update resume PDF\"\n          git push\n```\n\n## Check it out\n\nI'm sure there are many ways to improve it, and I'd love to hear your thoughts on it.\n\n[![Resume Repo](https://opengraph.githubassets.com/2e5e654555e7ca5ef034846549ecb28fe31bef8f03debe63bf3b5e9ff3123f89/rosnovsky/resume)](https://github.com/rosnovsky/resume)","src/content/blog/2024/02/06/resume-automation.md",[2655],"@assets/blog/covers/resume.png","0cdc81b99a297054",{html:2658,metadata:2659},"<blockquote>\n<p>On February 1, 2024, I was laid off from Okta.

So I need to convert my resume to PDF. I mean, I need to convert <em>every edit</em> to PDF. I then need to store this <em>every edit</em> in such a way that I won’t mix them up and send the wrong one to a potential employer.</p>\n<p>There are many different ways to convert Markdown to PDF. The proper one I should’ve used is with <code>pandoc</code>. But I’m not a proper person, so I went with <a href=\"https://github.com/simonhaenisch/md-to-pdf\">md-to-pdf</a> package for Node.js: it’s just easier to use out-of-the-box.</p>\n<pre class=\"language-typescript\" data-language=\"typescript\"><code is:raw=\"\" class=\"language-typescript\"><span class=\"token keyword\">import</span> mdToPdf <span class=\"token keyword\">from</span> <span class=\"token string\">'md-to-pdf'</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n\n<span class=\"token keyword\">export</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">const</span> <span class=\"token function-variable function\">markdownToPdf</span> <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">async</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>inputFilePath<span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token builtin\">string</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token operator\">=></span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n  <span class=\"token keyword\">try</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"token keyword\">const</span> pdf <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">await</span> <span class=\"token function\">mdToPdf</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span> path<span class=\"token operator\">:</span> inputFilePath <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n    <span class=\"token keyword\">return</span> pdf<span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n  <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">catch</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>error<span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token builtin\">any</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"token builtin\">console</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token function\">error</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token template-string\"><span class=\"token template-punctuation string\">`</span><span class=\"token string\">Error occurred: </span><span class=\"token interpolation\"><span class=\"token interpolation-punctuation punctuation\">${</span>error<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>message<span class=\"token interpolation-punctuation punctuation\">}</span></span><span class=\"token template-punctuation string\">`</span></span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n    <span class=\"token keyword\">throw</span> error<span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n  <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n</code></pre>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If a recruiter asks for a resume in <code>.docx</code> or some other exotic/proprietary format, it’s a huge red flag.

Just kidding, it’s right there in a folder in the Github repo. I can download the PDF to send it over to someone, or I can just send them a link to the repo (or directly to the <code>.pdf</code> file).</p>\n<p>I can have branches for every job I’m applying for. I can go back in time to a particular version of the resume that performed better. I can see changes made over time. It’s all there, in the repo.</p>\n<h2 id=\"fun-with-it\">Fun with it</h2>\n<p>I’m not doing any of the above by hand. What am I, some caveman?! Github Actions to the rescue! Whenever I push an update to the resume, it triggers a <a href=\"https://github.com/rosnovsky/resume/blob/main/.github/workflows/generate-pdf.yml\">workflow that converts the resume to PDF</a> and stores it in the repo. It’s not perfect (there are quirks preventing me from easily implementing branch protection rules, paths are a bit wonky when it comes to tests, this sort of thing), but it’s a start.</p>\n<pre

Time to count the chickens (or something like that).",["Date","2023-12-31T15:00:00.000Z"],"There’s this tradition I’ve been following for over 2 decades now. At the end of every year, I’d make a post with a brief summary of what happened, how it all went down, and what are my hopes for the year ahead. Let’s get started, shall we?\n\n## Work\n\nWork got intense, then weird, then even more weird and more intense but more focused. This is a fairly general summary of my year at work. I worked a lot with unfamiliar tech (primarily, `Kubernetes`), and learned a lot as a result. For example, I've [moved this website](/blog/moving-to-k8s) and a few other projects to my own `k8s` cluster, and enabled a really neat CI/CD pipeline. There were a lot of changes, a lot of motion, and it's yet to be seen how all this stuff will affect my corner of Okta. Personally, I feel like I've grown a lot as an engineer, but we'll see if I actually did when annual performance evaluation happens early next year.\n\nI worked on a couple of interesting projects. Some of them were purely internal-facing productivity tools for account managers (with ML and a bunch of other fun stuff), some were customer facing, and others were explicitly security related. All of this was fun and, of course, challenging.\n\nOh, and I've got a new manager. I'm a bit sad that today is their last day at Okta. So, tomorrow I'll have an even newer manager. On the bright side, both the new one and the newer one are pretty awesome.\n\n## Life\n\nLife got quiet, even quieter than before. We camped quite a bit this year, went to San Juan island for the second year in a row; we love it there. I didn't hike, like, at all. I rarely leave the house in general.\n\nWent to a few concerts, including Ed Sheeran's one, from which we returned with our first COVID infection. The COVID part wasn't fun; the concert was great!\n\nOur child graduated from high school, got their driver's license, and now works a retail job. It's really cool to see this grown up begining _to adult_.\n\nMy spouse, among other things, is a Teamster now.\n\nI kept running [Lounge Town](https://lounge.town); it cost me roughly **$1,000** this year, but it brings joy and fun to hundreds of people. Totally worth it.\n\n## Books\n\nI've read a bunch of books, and re-read some more (think \"The Murderbot Dairies\"). These are the books I've enjoyed this year:\n\n- Red Team Blues\n- Silo (the whole thing)\n- Dune (finally, don't judge)\n- System Collapse\n- Lost in Time\n- The Witch King (started, halfway through already)\n\nThe old site used to have a library of all my books, so once I re-empliment this feature, I'll update the books above with proper links. Same goes for the games below.\n\n## Games\n\nGames were a bright spot in 2023. I enjoyed playing on my Deck, primarily, and a little bit on my monster of a desktop:\n\n![deck](assets/blog/posts/2023-a-year-in-review/deck.png)\n\n![systems](assets/blog/posts/2023-a-year-in-review/systems.png)\n\nReally loved Horizon Zero Dawn:\n\n![horizon zero dawn](../../../../../assets/blog/posts/2023-a-year-in-review/aloy.jpg)\n\nHades is another amazing game:\n\n![hades](../../../../../assets/blog/posts/2023-a-year-in-review/hades.jpg)\n\nIt turns out, I played quite a lot. I mean, I know I played for hundreds of hours, but didn't realize _how much_ it was!\n\n![compare](../../../../../assets/blog/posts/2023-a-year-in-review/compare.png)\n\nYou are what you play, I guess:\n\n![rose](../../../../../assets/blog/posts/2023-a-year-in-review/rose.png)\n\nThese are my favorite games this year:\n\n- Horizon Zero Dawn (on Ultrahard)\n- Hades\n- Dredge\n- Starfield\n- Cities: Skylines II\n- Dome Keeper\n- Last of Us. Part I\n- Cult of the Lamb\n- Cassette Beasts\n- Lies of P (a bit)\n- Elden Ring (just a bit)\n- Forza Horizon 4 (a little)\n- Stardeus\n- Life Is Strange: True Colors (a bit)\n- Cyberpunk 2077 (a little bit)\n\n## 2024\n\nI don't expect anything good out of 2024. I think I've learned my lesson: the lower the bar, the higher the chances to reach it. With this, I still hope Biden wins the election. I hope Putin dies. I hope Trump goes to prison for the rest of his life. I hope I'm not laid off. I hope my family is healthy and overall does well. Perhaps, we'll survive 2024, which would be pretty neat. Even if it's just the last hope that 2024 delivers, I'd be very glad.\n\nOn a more down-to-earth note, I really want to hike a bit next year. I want to travel somewhere where water is warm (think Cabo or Cancun kind of place). I want to finish a couple of my hobby projects (I struggle a lot with finishing projects. But starting projects? Not so much.)\n\n## Previous installments\n\n- [2022](/blog/2022-a-year-in-review)\n- [2021](/blog/2021-the-year-in-review)\n- [2020](/blog/2020-wont-be-missed)","src/content/blog/2023/12/31/2023-a-year-in-review.md",[2692,2693,2694,2695,2696,2697,2698],"assets/blog/posts/2023-a-year-in-review/deck.png","assets/blog/posts/2023-a-year-in-review/systems.png","../../../../../assets/blog/posts/2023-a-year-in-review/aloy.jpg","../../../../../assets/blog/posts/2023-a-year-in-review/hades.jpg","../../../../../assets/blog/posts/2023-a-year-in-review/compare.png","../../../../../assets/blog/posts/2023-a-year-in-review/rose.png","@assets/blog/posts/2023-a-year-in-review/aloy.jpg","0fd6098cb2b131be",{html:2701,metadata:2702},"<p>There’s this tradition I’ve been following for over 2 decades now.

I created a views counter for my blog, and loved the experience.",["Date","2024-03-13T00:00:00.000Z"],"{% callout title=\"Update\"  %}\nAs of September 2024, Astro DB has been officially deprecated: [Goodbye Studio, Hello DB](https://astro.build/blog/goodbye-astro-studio/).\n{% /callout %}\n\n## Astro DB\n\nYesterday, the [Astro](https://astro.build) team announced [Astro DB](https://astro.build/db/) and [Astro Studio](https://docs.astro.build/en/recipes/studio/). Astro DB is a fully-managed SQL database integrated directly with the framework, and Astro Studio is a hosted interface to Astro DB. Personally, I find this development significant for a few reasons:\n\n- Astro becomes more \"batteries included\"\n- Local DX involving running a local database gets much easier\n- It's just SQL so you can take it out at any moment and move to any other DB provider. The package for working with Astro DB, [@astrojs/db](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@astrojs/db), includes [Drizzle ORM](https://orm.drizzle.team/) so migration to a different provider should be relatively painless\n- Astro DB's free tier is generous but not _outrageously_ so (yes, it's a jab at [PlanetScale](https://planetscale.com/blog/planetscale-forever), I'm still salty); paid usage is _very_ reasonably priced\n- It's easier than ever to add \"advanced\" dynamic features to static sites\n\nYou may have a different set of reasons why it's worth talking about Astro DB, but we can probably agree that in this space, this is great news. The only thing to keep in mind is that it's still in \"Early Preview\" stage, so I wouldn't recommend relying on Astro DB for critical production workloads.\n\nAnyway, as soon as I saw the announcement, I jumped right in and tried to implement a feature for my blog: a basic page views counter. How hard could it be?\n\n## Page views counter\n\nI admit, it's not a very creative idea. My goal was to explore Astro DB, see how it works, so that I can actually use it for something fun later. So, page views counter it is.\n\nThe plan was simple:\n- Whenever somebody visits any page on my website, I'd record their visit in the database\n- To make this counter a little more resilient, I'd also record hashed user IP address and their hashed user agent (I don't want to collect or store _actual_ IPs and user agents, but I do want to be able to identify whether somebody is just hitting refresh or actually visiting a page)\n- I also need to record that page is being visited\n- I want to display the view counts per page\n- Finally, I want to display popular blog posts based on the number of page views\n\nMultiple improvements to this basic approach can be made. But for my exploration purpose, this is quite enough.\n\n### Configuration\n\nFirst things first. I'd need to install, enable, and configure @astrojs/db. There are different ways to install Astro integrations, and I usually prefer the automated one:\n\n```sh\npnpm astro add db\n```\n\nThis command installs the package, updates `astro.config.mjs`, and creates a new directory called `db` with `config.ts` and `seed.ts` files in it. That's about it. The project is ready, let's dive in.\n\nHere's what my `config.ts` looks like:\n\n```typescript\nimport { defineDb, defineTable, column } from 'astro:db';\n\nconst Visits = defineTable({\n  columns: {\n    id: column.number({ primaryKey: true }),\n    page: column.text({ default: 'home' }),\n    content: column.text({ default: \"none\" }),\n    pagination: column.number({ default: 1 }),\n    visitor_ip_hash: column.text(),\n    visitor_user_agent_hash: column.text(),\n    visitor_count: column.number({ default: 1 })\n  }\n});\n\n// https://astro.build/db/config\nexport default defineDb({\n  tables: { Visits }\n});\n```\n\nPretty self-explanatory: we import `defineDb` from `astro:db` so that we can define our database, `defineTable` so that we can define this database's tables, and `column`, you guessed it, so that we can define this table's columns. There's more we can do, but for now that's all we need.\n\nNow, if you've ever worked with a local database, you know you now need to actually start the local database, create tables, and seed it. Well, with Astro DB, you only need to do the last step - seed the db. And _need_ is really _want_: you're not _required_ to seed the database, it just makes life easier down the line.\n\n```typescript\nimport { db, Visits } from 'astro:db';\n\n// https://astro.build/db/seed\nexport default async function seed() {\n\tawait db.insert(Visits).values({\n\t\tpage: 'home',\n\t\tpagination: 1,\n\t\tvisitor_ip_hash: '30963a87dd481e4366237ed9cb37f001e24bcb865833be0036f7f081176b9812',\n\t\tvisitor_user_agent_hash: 'c08ae1ccbe7296f4d6589acb026c5a0379bb07f1915cca8829d4cead13211e26',\n\t\tvisitor_count: 10\n\t});\n}\n```\n\nThis file will create a record in the local database (you _can_ seed remote database as well!); whenever you restart your development server (`astro dev`), the database gets reset and re-seeded. How cool is that?!\n\nWhat's important here is that you now have access to `Visits` and `db` anywhere in your project, and can just use them right away!\n\n### Accessing Astro Studio\n\nBefore moving forward with the views counter implementation, let me quickly note a few things about local and remote databases.\n\nWhen you develop locally, the database is reset every time you restart the development server.\n\nWhen you're happy with the schema, you can push this schema to the remote database, the one that's going to be used when you deploy your project. The CLI is pretty straightforward here: you login to Astro Studio, link your local database to a (new) project, push local changes to this remote DB.\n\n```sh\nastro db login # Follow prompts, login with Github\n\nastro db link # Again, follow prompts, create a new project or link local db to an existing one\n\nastro db push # Tell the remote DB what you want it to look like\n```\n\nAs an added feature, you could also seed the remote database:\n\n```sh\nastro db execute db/seed.ts --remote # \"db/seed.ts\" here is just a path to the file where your seed data is.\n```\n\nOh, and you _can_ use the remote database locally! Just be _very_ careful.\n\n```sh\nastro dev --remote\n```\n\nNow, go to [Astro Studio](https://studio.astro.build/), log in, and click around. You'll see your new project and its database. Notice, that I have `SQL Console` enabled: if you need to just run a few SQL commands, it's a nice thing to have.\n\n![Astro Studio UI](assets/blog/posts/exploring-astro-db/astro-studio-ui.png)\n\nAs you can see, Astro Studio is pretty limited in what you can see and do there, but it does cover all the bases and again, it's an \"Early Preview\". What I use Studio the most for is inspecting records, and it does a pretty good job here.\n\n![Astro Studio database UI](assets/blog/posts/exploring-astro-db/astro-studio-db-ui.png)\n\n\n### Implementation\n\nAaaanyway, after I got my Astro DB all set up, I got to the actual implementation of the page views counter. I don't want to bore you with the details that are _very_ specific to my particular website, so I'd boil it down to more generic steps.\n\nThe first step is to figure out how we are going to register visits. There are multiple ways to approach this depending on what Astro [rendering `mode`](https://docs.astro.build/en/basics/rendering-modes/) you're using:\n\n- in `static` or `hybrid` mode, you could load a counter `pixel` (a 1x1 pixel image pointing to an [endpoint](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/endpoints/))\n- in `server` or `hybrid` mode with `export const prerender = false`, you could make a call directly to the endpoint that counts visits\n\nMy website is primarily static; I use `hybrid` mode so that I do have an option to disable prerendering when I need to. It actually poses some quite specific challenges that I won't go into here, but just keep this in mind: if something doesn't work the way you expect it to work, check your rendering mode first :)\n\nI've added my `pixel` to the footer of my site along with a `Views` component:\n\n```tsx\n// Footer.astro\n---\nconst currentPage = Astro.url.pathname.split('/') // naive \"give me the current page url\" kind of thing\ncurrentPage.shift() // oh, and remove the leading `/`\n---\n\n<Image\n  src={`/visitors/register.png?page=${currentPage}`}\n  loading=\"eager\"\n  aria-hidden=\"true\"\n  alt=\"tracking pixel\"\n  width=\"1\"\n  height=\"1\" />\n<Views client:only currentPage={currentPage} />\n```\n\nNow, I just need to actually register visits. That's where the magic happens!\n\n```ts\n// src/pages/visitors/register.ts\n\nexport const prerender = false;\n\nimport crypto from 'node:crypto';\nimport { db, Visits, eq, and } from 'astro:db';\nimport type { APIRoute } from 'astro';\n\nexport const GET: APIRoute = async (data) => {\n  const hash = (data: any) => crypto.createHash('sha256').update(data).digest('hex');\n\n  const userAgent: string = data.request.headers.get('User-Agent') || '';\n  const ip: string = data.clientAddress;\n  const pagePathName: string = data.request.url.split('=')[1];\n\n  const pagePaths = pagePathName ? pagePathName.split(',') : [];\n\n  // This is lazy and dumb, ignore it\n  let page = \"home\";\n  let content = \"none\";\n  let pagination = 1;\n\n\n  if (pagePathName.length === 0) {\n    page = 'home'\n  } else if (pagePaths.length === 1) {\n    page = pagePaths[0]\n  } else if (pagePaths.length === 2) {\n    page = pagePaths[0]\n    content = pagePaths[1]\n  } else if (pagePaths.length === 3) {\n    page = pagePaths[0]\n    content = pagePaths[1]\n    pagination = Number(pagePaths[2])\n  }\n  // The end of \"this is lazy and dumb, ignore it\"\n\n  const userAgentHash = hash(userAgent);\n  const ipHash = hash(ip);\n\n  const [visits] = await db\n    .select()\n    .from(Visits)\n    .where(\n      and(\n        eq(Visits.visitor_ip_hash, ipHash),\n        eq(Visits.visitor_user_agent_hash, userAgentHash),\n        eq(Visits.page, page),\n        eq(Visits.content, content),\n        eq(Visits.pagination, pagination)\n      )\n    )\n\n  if (visits) {\n    await db\n      .update(Visits)\n      .set({\n        visitor_count: visits.visitor_count + 1\n        })\n      .where(\n        eq(Visits.id, visits.id))\n  } else {\n    await db\n      .insert(Visits)\n      .values({\n        page,\n        content,\n        pagination,\n        visitor_ip_hash: ipHash,\n        visitor_user_agent_hash: userAgentHash\n    })\n  }\n\n  return new Response(JSON.stringify(visits), {\n    status: 200,\n    headers: {\n      \"Content-Type\": \"application/json\"\n    }\n  });\n}\n```\n\nI first check if a visit from this prticular visitor to this specific page has been registered already, and if so, I increase the count (I should also be checking for a timestamp here, come to think of it). If it's a brand new visit, I do `db.insert`.\n\nNow, how do we display the number of view? Here's what my `Views.tsx` looks like. NB: I'd very much prefer for this \"dynamic\" component to be an Astro component, alas it has to be (p)react (I'm using the official [preact integration](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/integrations-guide/preact/)).\n\n```tsx\n// Views.tsx\nimport { Suspense, lazy } from 'preact/compat'\nconst ViewsCount = lazy(() => import('./ViewsCount'))\n\nexport const Views = ({ currentPage }: { currentPage: string[] }) => {\n  return (\n    <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading Views...</div>}>\n      <ViewsCount currentPage={currentPage} />\n    </Suspense>\n  )\n}\n```\n\nAnd the actual counter:\n\n```tsx\n// ViewsCount.tsx\n\nimport { useEffect, useState } from 'react'\n\nconst ViewsCount = ({ currentPage }: { currentPage: string[] }): JSX.Element => {\n  const [views, setViews] = useState()\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n    const fetchViews = async () => {\n      const visitsData = await fetch(`/visitors/count?${currentPage}`)\n      const visits = await visitsData.json()\n\n      setViews(visits)\n    }\n\n    fetchViews()\n  }, [currentPage])\n\n  return (\n    <span className=\"mt-8 text-base text-slate-400/90 md:mt-0\">Views: {views}</span>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default ViewsCount;\n```\n\nThe combination of these two components results in a \"Loading Views...\" text while the view counter is fetching it's number from the DB, and the number of views when it's ready:\n\n![Views counter](assets/blog/posts/exploring-astro-db/views.png)\n\nFinally, how is the count number gets returned from the database?\n\n```ts\n// src/pages/visitors/count.ts\n\nimport { Visits, db, eq, and } from 'astro:db';\nimport type { APIRoute } from 'astro';\n\nexport const prerender = false;\n\nexport const GET: APIRoute = async (data) => {\n  const currentPage = data.request.url.split('?')[1].split(',')\n\n  const visitsData = await db\n    .select()\n    .from(Visits)\n    .where(\n      and(\n        // this is the part where some wierd specifics of my site come into play\n        eq(Visits.page, currentPage[0] === '' ? \"home\" : currentPage[0]),\n        eq(Visits.content, currentPage[1] ? currentPage[1] : 'none')\n      )\n    )\n\n  const visits = visitsData.reduce((acc, item) => {\n    return acc + item.visitor_count\n  }, 0)\n\n  return new Response(JSON.stringify(visits), {\n    status: 200,\n    headers: {\n      \"Content-Type\": \"application/json\"\n    }\n  });\n}\n```\n\nAnd there you have it. But we are not done yet!\n\n### Popular posts\n\nWith all this in place, I can now display not only latest posts but also most popular (by views). Note that I make sure to remove the three latest posts that are already featured on the page so that I don't get identical posts in Latest and Popular sections.\n\n```tsx\n---\nimport Container from '@components/Container.astro'\nimport BlogGrid from '@components/blog/BlogGrid.astro'\nimport Underline from '@components/illustrations/Underline.astro'\nimport { db, Visits, ne, and, desc } from 'astro:db'\nimport { getSortedPosts } from '@utils/posts'\nimport type { Post } from '@types'\nimport { getCollection } from 'astro:content'\n\nconst featuredPosts: Post[] = (await getSortedPosts()).slice(0, 3)\n\nconst popularPostsByVisits = new Set(\n  await db\n    .select()\n    .from(Visits)\n    .where(\n      ne(Visits.content, \"none\")\n    )\n    .orderBy(\n      desc(Visits.visitor_count))\n    .limit(6)\n    .then((rows) => (rows.map((row) => {\n      return row.content\n      })\n    ))\n)\n\nconst featuredPostsSlugs = featuredPosts.map((post) => post.slug.split('/').pop())\n\nconst popularPostsSlugs = Array.from(popularPostsByVisits).filter((slug) => !featuredPostsSlugs.includes(slug)).slice(0, 3)\n\nconst allPosts: Post[] = await getSortedPosts();\n\nconst popularPosts = allPosts.filter((post) => popularPostsSlugs.includes(post.slug.split('/').pop()!))\n---\n\n<section\n  class=\"overflow-hidden bg-white py-16 dark:bg-slate-900 sm:pt-24 lg:pt-28\"\n>\n  <Container>\n    <h2>Popular Posts</h2>\n    <BlogGrid posts={popularPosts} />\n  </Container>\n</section>\n\n```\n\n## All done!\n\nWell, now we are done. Setting up Astro DB was easy, it's easy to use, and it works as expected. I bet there are some awesome improvements coming, but in the meantime, Astro DB is my go-to for all my Astro-based projects.\n\nHow would you use Astro DB?

I wanted to do at least two overnight hikes this summer, but fell short. I've only done one day hike at Monte Cristo in Henry M. Jackson Wilderness near Glacier Peak. I've [been here before](/blog/monte-cristo-ghost-town-trail), [twice](/blog/hiking-season-failed-kickoff), and I know this trail well: it's an easy one, with enough scenery to keep you entertained. At the end of the trail, I laid down in the grass in the middle of an abandoned town of Monte Cristo and read a book for a bit. Really nice way to spend a day.\n\n![Two weathered signs leaning against a large rock formation in a forested area. The signs read \"Welcome to Monte Cristo\" and \"Monte Cristo\" in faded lettering.

This's another one of those \"[I've been here before](/blog/white-pass-hike)\" hikes, but it didn't go as planned. I did arrive at the trailhead on Friday afternoon; there were dozens of cars parked around the entrance, and the spot I used to pitch my tent was covered with fallen old growth trees. I did find a spot between the branches, trunks, and the rest of the mayhem, but as I was pitching my tent, I realized that I forgot to pack two very importnatn things: a headlamp and some bug repellent. While not having a headlamp wasn't too bit of a problem, not having bug repellent was. Like, it was bad. I've pitched my tent in under 10 minutes, and by the time I got inside, I was basically one huge mosquito bite. It was quite miserable and sealed the whole hike. I enjoyed sleeping in the tent, but it the morning, I packed up and left.\n\n![A campsite in a dense forest. A gray tent is set up among tall evergreen trees.

And when in Poulsbo, make sure to check out [Away With Words](https://awaywithwordsbookshop.com/), it's a really, _really_ nice store!\n\n![A collection of book-related items on a wooden surface.

A group of figure skaters in colorful costumes stand on the ice rink, facing the audience. Behind them is a large banner in blue and yellow (colors of the Ukrainian flag) with the message \"THANK YOU FOR YOUR SUPPORT\". The scene suggests a show of solidarity with Ukraine. The venue appears to be a professional ice rink with stadium-style seating visible in the background.](assets/blog/posts/life-update-september-2024/IMG_4399.JPEG)\n\nWent to a really cool ice skating event \"Skate for Ukraine: The Forest Song\", featuring not only some of the students of a local ice skating school run by our friends but also independent Ukraine's first _ever_ Olympic gold medalist [Oksana Baiul-Farina](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oksana_Baiul) who turned out to be an absolute treasure of a human being. I'm not sure how much money was raised overall, but it's in the tens of thousands of dollars. If you want to [chip in](https://www.volia.fund/), I'd really appreciate it!\n\n### Foo Fighters\n\n![An expansive nighttime view of a large-scale outdoor concert. The image shows a massive stage setup with multiple large screens displaying close-ups of performers. Bright lights and smoke effects create a dramatic atmosphere. The Foo Fighters logo is prominently displayed above the stage. A dense crowd fills the foreground, stretching back as far as the eye can see. The scene is at the Seattle Mariners' home field the T-Mobile Park, with city lights visible in the background.](assets/blog/posts/life-update-september-2024/IMG_4430.JPEG)\n\nThinking \"we need to support our local bands\", my spouse and I went to the [Foo Fighters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foo_Fighters) concert. It was a really cool show, and I'm glad we went. I'm not a huge fan of their music, but I am a huge fan of live music in general and Dave Grohl personally. The show was supposed to start at 8 pm after all the opening acts, and I still can't get over the fact that FF were on stage at 8:00 pm on the dot. I'm old enough to say this with a lot of confidence: it's extremely rare for a band to begin on time; I've _never_ seen this happen before. Mad respect. Also, they did play my favorites, \"Monkey Wrench\" and \"Everlong\", so I'm really happy with the show :)\n\n### Metallica\n\n![A close-up of a large, illuminated display screen at the Metallica concert in Lumen Field. The screen shows vibrant artwork featuring the Metallica logo, a fierce-looking wolf, and skulls, all in shades of blue, white, and red. The image is taken from below, showing part of the stadium's structural framework above. The dramatic lighting and artwork create a powerful visual impact, fitting for a metal concert.](assets/blog/posts/life-update-september-2024/IMG_4507.JPEG)\n\nDid I mention that I love live music? Well, sometimes it gets weird. I don't listen to Metallica aside from literally two songs: \"Nothing Else Matters\" and \"The Unforgiven\" (both parts). But when an opportunity to see a truly legendary band in concert comes up, I'm always ready to jump on the bandwagon.\n\n![A striking view of a large stadium concert - it's day two of Metallica at Lumen Field. The image shows massive yellow cylindrical structures suspended above the crowd, each decorated with a stylized cityscape design. These are part of an elaborate stage setup, illuminated against the darkening sky. The stadium's roof is visible in the background, and a dense crowd can be seen below, creating an atmosphere of excitement and spectacle.](assets/blog/posts/life-update-september-2024/IMG_4506.JPEG)\n\nIt's almost funny how it took me going to the concert to realize that I _do not_ like Metallica, I just like two of their songs. It doesn't mean that the show wasn't great or that they did a poor job: the show was excellent, with a lot of energy, visuals, and great atmosphere! If 15-year-old me was told that one day he'd be standing just a few dozen yards away from James Hetfield and sing along to \"The Unforgiven\", he'd never believe it. Yet here we are.\n\n![An atmospheric shot of the Metallica concert at Lumen Field, capturing the scale and energy of the event. Large cylindrical screens hang from the ceiling, displaying close-ups of the band performing. Bright stage lights and smoke effects fill the air, creating a dramatic ambiance. In the foreground, a guitarist (James Hetfield) is visible on stage, illuminated by golden light. The image conveys the immersive and high-energy experience of the live performance.](assets/blog/posts/life-update-september-2024/IMG_4511.JPEG)\n\nHelen recorded the video below:\n\n<YouTube\n  id=\"https://youtu.be/sTrio7fr2CE?si=QD-6PdpN0Lzd52Y-\"\n  className=\"mx-auto min-w-full\"\n/>\n\n## Movies\n\nNot much to report here. I've finally watched [Nimona](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt19500164/), and absolutely loved it. So much so that I read my teenager's copy of the [original graphic novel](https://bookshop.org/p/books/nimona-noelle-stevenson/6432916?ean=9780062278227) (which is a bit different but as good as the movie).\n\nSince this is a Deadpool household, we went to see [Deadpool and Wolverine](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6263850/) almost as soon as it came out. It was excellent (if you're into this kind of thing, at least), but not as good as the first two in my entirely clueless opinion. Don't get me wrong, it's a very fun movie, but I felt like it lacked some of the Mr. Pool's magic of the first two. Perhaps, I just need to watch it again when it's released on streaming.\n\nFinally, I did a thing that I wanted to do for, like, a decade: I watched all of the Marvel Cinematic Universe movies in its timeline order: from the first Iron Man all the way to the latest Marvels. Loved it a lot, 5 stars, no notes.\n\n## Games\n\nAs far as games go, I've finally gotten around to playing through [Firewatch](https://www.firewatchgame.com/), a nice and chill game by Panic, and [Life is Strange: True Colors](https://lifeisstrange.square-enix-games.com/en-us/games/life-is-strange-true-colors). The latter was a bit short for my taste (or at least it felt noticeably shorter than the original _Life is Strange_ and _Life is Strange: Before the Storm_.) Still, it was a lot of fun. Oh, and I've been playing [Hades II](https://www.supergiantgames.com/games/hades-ii/) which is in early access on Steam now. It's entirely possible that the sequel will be even better that the first installment, let me tell you that!\n\n## Hope & Joy\n\n![Political figures on stage celebrating victory - Vice President Kamala Harris, Second Gentelmen Doug Emhoff, Governor Tim Walz and his wife Gwen Walz.

Everything is new, but somehow it all feels the same.",["Date","2024-06-16T00:00:00.000Z"],"I have been neglecting this blog for a while now. Not that I don't have things to post, I really do. I just don't have the energy to do it. And it also feels like I'm not doing anything at all, nothing is new, nothing really matters. I guess, I'm not in the healthiest of headspaces right now, and it's been like that for a while.\n\nAnyway, I'm going to try my best to update this blog more often. Let's see how it goes.\n\n## New job\n\nAs mentioned before, I was laid of from Okta in February 2024. It was an even more sobering experience than I expected. Like, I knew that corporations are souleless people squeezing machines, but I haven't experience this side of the sqeeze before. 700 people were laid off, including my entire team, my manager, their manager and a bunch of people on sibling teams; some of the most talented people I've ever worked with were discarded by Okta. It's safe to say that a big part of this layoff was so that Okta could get rid of more Auth0 people - those of us who remember working for a great company, doing shit that matters in a way that actually makes sense. Knowing that, it still stings. Sure, it's not our fault - it's 100% a failure of Okta's senior leadership, and it still stings. It's fair to say that we've got a somewhat satisfactory severence, and guess what? It still stings.\n\nAnyway. I think it will take me a long while to really get over this. The level of corporate distrust and cynicism I've been experiencing is a bit too much even for me. Still, life goes on, and we all have to move on.\n\nThese days, I'm working as a Senior Developer at [BeyondID](https://beyondid.com/), a managed identity service provider. My job is to build and integrate [Auth0](https://auth0.com/) into customer's systems. It's been an interesting experience so far, but it's too early to tell how it will turn out long term. I'm not even sure if there is such a thing as \"long term\" anymore. See my problem now? :(\n\n## New projects\n\nSince February, I've been toying with a bunch of slow-moving projects.\n\nI've released an [Astro Mastodon](https://github.com/rosnovsky/astro-mastodon) package for embedding Mastodon posts into Astro websites.\n\n`@rosnovsky@lounge.town:112623550037161567`\n\nI've built a [Spinup](https://github.com/rosnovsky/spinup) app for quickly setting up new Linux/Mac computers. This one is still in the early stages, but I just had a chance to use it _in real life_ when setting up my new laptop and it's been pretty cool.\n\n![](assets/blog/posts/life-update-june-2024/spinup.png)\n\nI've been working on a new service for myself and my family that stores and makes it easy to search through our most important documents (passports, IDs, taxes, etc). It's been going slowly, but this project got me really excited, and I've been working on it on and off over weekends for a few months now. Not sure I'd ever release it to the public, but who knows.\n\nI've just build my first laptop - a [Framework 16](https://frame.work/products/laptop16-diy-amd-7040). It's the most exciting piece of technology I've seen in years. It replaced my 2019 Dell XPS 15, and I'm _really_ happy with it.\n\n![](assets/blog/posts/life-update-june-2024/framework16.png)\n\n## New games\n\nThe latest one that consumed my entirely is Supergiant's [Hades II](https://www.supergiantgames.com/games/hades-ii/). It's just like Hades, but even better.\n\nI've also been playing [Horizon Forbidden West](https://www.guerrilla-games.com/games/) for a while now (well, since it's been released on Steam, that is). Another great sequel, really enjoying it.\n\n[Cassette Beasts](https://www.cassettebeasts.com/), [Dome Keeper](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1637320/Dome_Keeper/), [Factorio](https://www.factorio.com/), [Last of Us Part I](https://store.steampowered.com/agecheck/app/1888930/), [Dredge](https://www.dredge.game/) - there are quite a few games that I've been enjoying lately. Still can't get over how much fun my Steam Deck has been!\n\n---\n\nWent to the Red Hot Chili Peppers concert at the Gorge a couple of weeks ago.

This year sucked in so many ways, but there were a few bright spots as well.",["Date","2024-12-31T08:00:00.000Z"],false,"import { LinkPreview } from 'astro-embed';\n\nAnother terrible year is coming to an end, and it's a tradition I have here to write up a year in review. I've been doing this in one form or another since 2003, and I'll keep doing it for as long as I can. Let's begin.\n\n## Laid off\n\nThe year started off with yours truly being laid off. [Okta](https://www.okta.com) discarded me and dozens of my colleagues just like that. My entire team, a few of my \"sibling\" teams, my manager, their manager, all got laid off. It is pretty clear to me that Okta was cleaning house from [Auth0](https://auth0.com) leftovers - people who can't/won't think like corporate drones. Oh, well. I never liked Okta, their culture being at odds with Auth0's culture, their botched acquisition of Auth0 (and how they tried to cover up their failure), and many other things. It was sad to lose a job and to lose my team. But I'm glad to not work at Okta anymore.\n\n## New job\n\nThe day of the layoffs, a recruiter from [BeyondID](https://beyondid.com) reached out to me and offered me a job: a Senior Developer position working exclusively with Auth0 stack and helping their customers develop and deploy CIAM in various shapes and forms. I agreed, and in April started my new job there. The difficulty for me is that it's a Professional Services kind of role, and I prefer product-focused work. I'm still unsure how it's going to work out in the long run, but it's been going all right so far.\n\n## Few hikes, some travel\n\nI wanted to hike much more this year, but alas. My only overnight trip to the [Glacier Peak](https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/hikes/glacier-peak) area was a disaster of my own making, and I had to cut the trip short. Another hike to the ghost town of [Monte Cristo](https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/hikes/monte-cristo-ghost-town) was a success, but it kind of wraps up my hiking for the year. I'll do better next year.\n\nWe went to the Coast this year with my wife, my child, and their partner. It was a calm, relaxing trip, and we had a lot of fun.\n\n## Linkin Park is back\n\nIn September 2024, [Linkin Park](https://www.linkinpark.com) reunited, and we [flew to LA](/blog/linkin-park-is-back) for their comeback show.\n\nIt is probably the most memorable event of the year for me. Not the LA show, but just the fact that LP is back.\n\nIn November, we went to see them live in Texas, which was an entire experience in itself: flying to Dallas in the early morning, arriving in the afternoon, settling into our Airbnb, the show itself, and a visit to the [Dealey Plaza](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dealey_Plaza) the next day. All in all, it was a lot, and I mean a lot of fun.\n\nSince the release of their new album \"From Zero\", they also announced a world tour next year. And we are going to all three of their PNW shows in September 2025: in Portland, Seattle, and Vancouver, BC. It's nice to have something to look forward to in 2025.\n\n## Games\n\nEver since I've got myself a [Steam Deck](https://www.steamdeck.com), I've been playing a lot of video games.\n\n![Stats](assets/blog/posts/2024-a-year-in-review/steam1.png)\n\n![Stats](assets/blog/posts/2024-a-year-in-review/steam2.png)\n\n![Stats](assets/blog/posts/2024-a-year-in-review/steam3.png)\n\nLately, I've been really enjoying the game [Stardew Valley](https://www.stardewvalley.net).\n\nI guess games and music are how I escape from reality. Not a healthy coping mechanism, but it will have to do, at least for now.\n\n## Projects\n\nI've built quite a few things this year, most of those things I've built for work. Still, I've got a hobby project I love: a website that displays the music I'm listening to.\n\n<LinkPreview id=\"https://music.rosnovsky.us\" />\n\nNo major open source contributions this year; I was just trying to keep my head above water.\n\n## Music\n\nAside from the obvious (obvious being \"From Zero\" by Linkin Park), this year I've discovered [The Linda Lindas](https://thelindalindas.com), [Rancid](https://rancidrancid.com), [Bad Omens](https://badomensofficial.com), [A Day to Remember](https://adtr.com), [Yellowcard](https://yellowcardrock.com), [Sleep Token](https://sleep-token.com), [Rise Against](https://www.riseagainst.com), and some other bands.\n\nThis year, I've completely transitioned off of Apple Music: all my music is now in my Plex library, ripped from CDs I've bought. We also got a good vinyl record player and have been enjoying it a lot.\n\nI also love the fact that [The Offspring](https://offspring.com), [blink-182](https://www.blink182.com), [The All-American Rejects](https://www.allamericanrejects.com), and some other legendary bands released new albums this year.\n\n## Books/Movies/TV Shows\n\nDidn't read much this year, and mostly re-watched old TV shows and movies. Want to note the [\"Arcane\"](https://www.netflix.com/title/81435684) series (it's awesome!), and the [\"Deadpool & Wolverine\"](https://www.marvel.com/movies/deadpool-and-wolverine) movie.\n\n## Looking forward\n\nThere's no chance that 2025 will be a better year than 2024, which sucked in many different ways. Still, I'm looking forward to the live shows, family reuniting here in Washington, and otherwise not dying, I guess.\n\nI hope to take better care of my mental and physical health next year, hike some more, spend time on San Juan Island, and write more.\n\nAnyway, thanks for following along, and see you next year!\n\n### Previous installments\n\n- [2023: a Year in Review](/blog/2023-a-year-in-review)\n- [2022: a Year in Review](/blog/2022-a-year-in-review)\n- [2021: a Year in Review](/blog/2021)\n- [2020: a Year in Review](/blog/2020-you-won-t-be-missed)","src/content/blog/2024/12/31/2024-a-year-in-review.mdx",[2778],"assets/blog/posts/2024-a-year-in-review/2024-a-year-in-review.jpg","c029e2ed3e430b17","2024/12/31/2024-a-year-in-review.mdx","2024/12/25/live-music-in-my-life",{id:2781,data:2783,body:2790,filePath:2791,assetImports:2792,digest:2794,legacyId:2795,deferredRender:68},{title:2784,image:2785,category:74,description:2788,publishDate:2789,draft:2774},"Live music in my life",{src:2786,alt:2787},"__ASTRO_IMAGE_assets/blog/posts/live-music-in-my-life/live-music.png"," ","Since I've moved out of Russia in 2011, I've been to dozens of concerts.

It was a 3-hour drive from Vancouver, WA to Kent, but it was worth it.\n\n<MuxPlayer\n  playbackId=\"Gt01i7nBL78u38MxsZZY801KfPYbB9uoouxwAixRiLhos\"\n  style={{ aspectRatio: 16 / 9 }}\n  loading=\"viewport\"\n  thumbnailTime=\"24\"\n  title=\"Scorpions - Kent, WA\"\n  accentColor=\"#f97316\"\n  preload=\"none\"\n  client:load\n/>\n\n## Yann Tiersen\n\n### Crystal Ballroom, Portland, OR\n\nI've got no images from this show - in all honesty, there was nothing to _see_, Yann Tiersen should be listened to. We went to the show because we love Amelie and Goodbye Lenin.\n\n# 2016\n\n## Zemfira\n\n### SoDo Showbox, Seattle, WA\n\nI've seen Zemfira live countless times, primarily at festivals. She half-assed this show, was rude to the audience, and overall sucked. This was my first and last time seeing her live.\n\n<MuxPlayer\n  playbackId=\"n01fbWdwWPJjTXdYTezbSZG4aWiQtQvtlU7hC3ENNHos\"\n  style={{ aspectRatio: 16 / 9 }}\n  loading=\"viewport\"\n  thumbnailTime=\"24\"\n  title=\"Zemfira - Seattle\"\n  preload=\"none\"\n  accentColor=\"#FF0000\"\n  client:load\n/>\n\n# 2017\n\n## RHCP\n\n### Moda Center, Portland, OR\n\nWe decided to go literally hours before the show started. We bought tickets while we were in line at the door. It was fun! My only complaint is that sound felt a bit off.\n\n<MuxPlayer\n  playbackId=\"otIzPFK007o1N1wmHQo7Cw3D7etwOUS0202YAIH3sZlFVs\"\n  style={{ aspectRatio: 16 / 9 }}\n  loading=\"viewport\"\n  thumbnailTime=\"24\"\n  title=\"RHCP - Portland\"\n  preload=\"none\"\n  accentColor=\"#FF0000\"\n  client:load\n/>\n\n<MuxPlayer\n  playbackId=\"SNqmYmV3pXV3so2vlE7ELaYrxswf5JI32p8SPrN1rVU\"\n  style={{ aspectRatio: 16 / 9 }}\n  loading=\"viewport\"\n  thumbnailTime=\"24\"\n  title=\"RHCP - Portland (2)\"\n  preload=\"none\"\n  accentColor=\"#FF0000\"\n  client:load\n/>\n\n## Fall Out Boy\n\n### Key Arena, Seattle, WA\n\nWe were supposed to go to two shows at Key Arena in 2017. The first one was Linkin Park touring their \"One More Light\" album; it got cancelled for obvious reasons. The second one was Fall Out Boy, and it was a great show!\n\n<MuxPlayer\n  playbackId=\"02DNH1ZwIJF000061fc6cnqYreO2kKOjuqWAh2ixVl5Xpk\"\n  style={{ aspectRatio: 16 / 9 }}\n  loading=\"viewport\"\n  thumbnailTime=\"24\"\n  title=\"Fall Out Boy - Seattle\"\n  preload=\"none\"\n  accentColor=\"#FF0000\"\n  client:load\n/>\n\n## Bi-2\n\n### Neptune Theatre, Seattle, WA\n\nThis one is funny. We drove to Seattle from Vancouver, WA, to see Bi-2 live - it was a gift for my birthday. We stayed at a hotel in Bothell, WA, and had a \"meet and greet\" with the band. Funny enough, later that year, we moved to Bothell, and I drove past the hotel every day on my way to work.\n\n![Meet and Greet](assets/blog/posts/live-music-in-my-life/IMG_1595.JPG)\n\nThe show itself was a blast. Helen was invited as a photographer, and given that Bi-2 is one of her favorive bands ever, she had a great time!\n\n<MuxPlayer\n  playbackId=\"f2OtJZcUgZve7m00PxrC7gEJ02PAWQoUTSKq717ad8C6E\"\n  style={{ aspectRatio: 16 / 9 }}\n  loading=\"viewport\"\n  thumbnailTime=\"24\"\n  title=\"Bi-2 - Seattle\"\n  preload=\"none\"\n  accentColor=\"#FF0000\"\n  client:load\n/>\n\n# 2018\n\n## P!nk\n\n### Key Arena, Seattle, WA\n\nWhenever I hear \"oh, the show was amazing\" I think to myself \"But how does it compare to what Pink does at her shows?\". Literally, I've never seen anything like this show. I even wonder sometimes if it's fair to call other concerts I've been to \"shows\". Absolutely incredible, will 100% go again!\n\n<MuxPlayer\n  playbackId=\"JfNwEQ1IdMxk8feOEimnkuezWFSQLs02sOyBwdRBrTo4\"\n  style={{ aspectRatio: 16 / 9 }}\n  loading=\"viewport\"\n  thumbnailTime=\"266\"\n  title=\"P!nk - Seattle\"\n  preload=\"none\"\n  accentColor=\"#FF0000\"\n  client:load\n/>\n\n## Mumiy Troll\n\n### Neptune Theatre, Seattle, WA\n\nI've seen MT in concert many times, but as with Zemfira, primarily at festivals. This show was the first one Mumiy Troll played in Seattle, and it was glorious. Enjoyed every minute of it.\n\n<MuxPlayer\n  playbackId=\"tSXBF35xg00EnSYnF009JBvZhcnhoujlFJ6FZFdK6dNRw\"\n  style={{ aspectRatio: 16 / 9 }}\n  loading=\"viewport\"\n  thumbnailTime=\"24\"\n  title=\"Mumiy Troll - Seattle\"\n  preload=\"none\"\n  accentColor=\"#FF0000\"\n  client:load\n/>\n\n## Evanesence, Lindsey Stirling\n\n### White River Amphiteatre, Auburn, WA\n\nThere's not much to say about this one. We were running late, traffic at the event parking was horrible, and we missed most of Lindsey Stirling's set. When it comes to the Evanesence, the show was a bit of a disappointment for me personally. I'm not the biggest Evanesence fan, and the songs I were there for were some weird acustic versions. Folks around me loved it though, so I'm glad we got to see it.\n\n![Evanesence](assets/blog/posts/live-music-in-my-life/IMG_3922.JPEG)\n\n## Mike Shinoda\n\n### San Francisco, CA\n\nAnother memorable experience. It was a rare show that Mike played in our vicinity, so we jumped on a plane to San Francisco. It was my first time seeing bits of Linking Park in person, and although I enjoyed the show, it was really sad that I won't get to see Linking Park in concert, ever. Let's pin this thought for later lol.\n\n<MuxPlayer\n  playbackId=\"5K6lwJg7y8G5YG02Le01zXYMboDSihNjY7hwOTiFIuTus\"\n  style={{ aspectRatio: 16 / 9 }}\n  loading=\"viewport\"\n  thumbnailTime=\"24\"\n  title=\"Mike Shinoda - San Francisco\"\n  preload=\"none\"\n  accentColor=\"#FF0000\"\n  client:load\n/>\n\n## Twenty One Pilots\n\n### Tacoma Dome, Tacoma, WA\n\nOne of the shows we went to see just because we could. And I'm really glad we did: the show was great, they performed every song I liked, and to my surprise, I discovered even more songs to explore and enjoy. \"Chlorine\", for example, now has a permanent place in my Favorites playlist!\n\n<MuxPlayer\n  playbackId=\"hxb02Uci97IQ8ymDNfYvOeMK6bl102dnouOKNJL5XD7y00\"\n  style={{ aspectRatio: 16 / 9 }}\n  loading=\"viewport\"\n  thumbnailTime=\"24\"\n  title=\"Twenty One Pilots - Tacoma\"\n  preload=\"none\"\n  accentColor=\"#FF0000\"\n  client:load\n/>\n\n# 2019\n\n## One Ok Rock\n\n### SoDo Showbox, Seattle, WA\n\nI was not in the right state of mind to truly enjoy the show, but I can say with confidence that they gave their 100%.\n\n<MuxPlayer\n  playbackId=\"5NDlbrkw00F2C3trNnjzCF1Prqz1NhEbCmqGNI6UjPiI\"\n  style={{ aspectRatio: 16 / 9 }}\n  loading=\"viewport\"\n  thumbnailTime=\"24\"\n  title=\"One Ok Rock - Seattle\"\n  preload=\"none\"\n  accentColor=\"#FF0000\"\n  client:load\n/>\n\n## Rolling Stones\n\n### CenturyLink Field, Seattle, WA\n\nYet another \"because we could\" show that we went to. I'm not a fan of the band, but I enjoyed the show. Classical music is fun! :)))\n\n<MuxPlayer\n  playbackId=\"r02rDouNXmFtzQJUlJo4jXNoEIJU2vmSGtk7jO00FxlFo\"\n  style={{ aspectRatio: 16 / 9 }}\n  loading=\"viewport\"\n  thumbnailTime=\"24\"\n  title=\"Rolling Stones - Seattle\"\n  preload=\"none\"\n  accentColor=\"#FF0000\"\n  client:load\n/>\n\n## Bryan Adams\n\n### WAMU, Seattle, WA\n\nBecause we could. (it becomes a thieme, doesn't it?)\n\nAnd then \"Summer of '69\", \"(Everything I Do) I Do It for You\", and some other hits that I happily sang-along to. Yay!\n\n<MuxPlayer\n  playbackId=\"NAsFWOAALFYvIS102KfY602T00Cj8c346An4lFEEmQuZqE\"\n  style={{ aspectRatio: 16 / 9 }}\n  loading=\"viewport\"\n  thumbnailTime=\"24\"\n  title=\"Bryan Adams - Seattle\"\n  preload=\"none\"\n  accentColor=\"#FF0000\"\n  client:load\n/>\n\n## Jade Bird\n\n### Showbox, Seattle, WA\n\nWe were not supposed to go to _this_ show. I wasn't supposed to go at all. Yet we ended up going. We didn't know the artist, didn't know any of the opening acts, and basically had no idea what to expect. And we loved it! Jade is such a great singer, pure, raw, honest, and so talented! I couldn't find any pictures or videos of the performance, but just trust me, it was amazing.\n\n## Mumiy Troll\n\n### Showbox, Seattle, WA\n\nInterestingly, this second show we went to was a bit off. Don't get me wrong, it was great, but somehow it felt like a \"let's quickly make some money and leave\" kind of deal. Still, it was quite a performance!\n\n<MuxPlayer\n  playbackId=\"eb2zXfONjfu31nMw5Om9MSc1ENZB0101A9T024R66APx7E\"\n  style={{ aspectRatio: 16 / 9 }}\n  loading=\"viewport\"\n  thumbnailTime=\"24\"\n  title=\"Mumiy Troll - Seattle\"\n  preload=\"none\"\n  accentColor=\"#FF0000\"\n  client:load\n/>\n\n# 2021\n\n## Weezer, Fall Out Boy, Green Day, Lindsey Stirling\n\n### Lumen Field/WAMU, Seattle, WA\n\nOur first show \"after\" COVID.\n\nGreenday performed in Seattle right after Chester Bennington's death, and back then I wasn't ready for it. And I've regretted missing it ever since. So as soon as this show was announced, we got our tickets. I'm less familiar with Weezer than with other bands, but I've got a few songs I like and they performed them. I also have to note that it's another example of me dicovering more music I like at live shows!\n\nFall Out Boy set was phenomenal! The last time I saw them live was at a closed arena, and boy, what a difference open air can make! This show was on a next level, I'm telling you!\n\nGreen Day is one of my all-time favorite bands. And I absolutely loved the entire set. I also vowed to never miss their concert again ;)\n\nFinally, a day or two later, there was a show by Lindsey Stirling (the one we partially missed back in 2018, the one with Evanesence, remember?). We went all in this time, with meet and greet, backstage, VIP seating and all. She was incredible, as always!\n\n<MuxPlayer\n  playbackId=\"1wFhHUiHJIqZU3ioz1RBFonJYAxQCbfYq6QVY01FDCoo\"\n  style={{ aspectRatio: 16 / 9 }}\n  loading=\"viewport\"\n  thumbnailTime=\"24\"\n  title=\"Weezer, Fall Out Boy, Green Day, Lindsey Stirling\"\n  preload=\"none\"\n  accentColor=\"#FF0000\"\n  client:load\n/>\n\n# 2022\n\n## Imagine Dragons\n\n### Climate Pledge Arena, Seattle, WA\n\nThis show was in March 2022. All I remember about that period of time is war. Russia had just invaded Ukraine, and there was nothing else on our minds. We were debating for a while whether to go to the show or not - I mean, we booked it almost a year earlier - and decided that we could always leave it we realize that we can't really enjoy it with everything else going on. While we were sitting in the VIP lounge before the show, we were discussing troop movements, casualties, and the like. A couple nearby started chatting with us all of a sudden, like, \"What's your favorite Imagine Dragons song?\", \"Have you been to their show before?\", and so on. It felt strange for a moment, unlit we realized that they were wholeheartedly trying to get our minds off the war, think about something else, get us into more positive mood. We respected and appreciated them for that.\n\nThe show was a blast, an absolute blast, I'm telling you!\n\n<MuxPlayer\n  playbackId=\"snT9681qBsCHUrwArc2pmtynN1SDuNGFV200dbtdNu3g\"\n  style={{ aspectRatio: 16 / 9 }}\n  loading=\"viewport\"\n  thumbnailTime=\"24\"\n  title=\"Imagine Dragons - Seattle\"\n  preload=\"none\"\n  accentColor=\"#FF0000\"\n  client:load\n/>\n\n## Scorpions\n\n### Tacoma Dome, Tacoma, WA\n\nI think this was my last time seeing Scorpions live. When I went to their show in Kent, it was their \"final tour\". Then they played another show in Seattle. It was also their \"last tour\". Yet, here we are, they are coming to Tacoma Dome again. I can't pour my heart out every time as if it's the last time. They also get older and older, and I decided that this is how I want to remember them. And in my book, it was their best show ever.\n\n![Scorpions](assets/blog/posts/live-music-in-my-life/IMG_0189.JPEG)\n\n<MuxPlayer\n  playbackId=\"YULgD02yTrXRmcTiX3dXQoTfBZnVZHgOaHLVjSSOcIRg\"\n  style={{ aspectRatio: 16 / 9 }}\n  loading=\"viewport\"\n  thumbnailTime=\"24\"\n  title=\"Scorpions - Tacoma\"\n  preload=\"none\"\n  accentColor=\"#FF0000\"\n  client:load\n/>\n\n<MuxPlayer\n  playbackId=\"TEZITiJfKXBy02uqUQjc8CuCaLzpHs4Eg602Z5LRyocVc\"\n  style={{ aspectRatio: 16 / 9 }}\n  loading=\"viewport\"\n  thumbnailTime=\"24\"\n  title=\"Scorpions - Tacoma\"\n  preload=\"none\"\n  accentColor=\"#FF0000\"\n  client:load\n/>\n\n<MuxPlayer\n  playbackId=\"xETpRvIiKK2mSVEYRlUxM1d3RWDPBCYw8Mcj6JCbR01A\"\n  style={{ aspectRatio: 16 / 9 }}\n  loading=\"viewport\"\n  thumbnailTime=\"31\"\n  title=\"Scorpions - Tacoma\"\n  preload=\"none\"\n  accentColor=\"#FF0000\"\n  client:load\n/>\n\n<MuxPlayer\n  playbackId=\"YIl2KIaPEKlyZOpe3hjo6TRre2rAMNMenoGwMqrrVxg\"\n  style={{ aspectRatio: 16 / 9 }}\n  loading=\"viewport\"\n  thumbnailTime=\"6\"\n  title=\"Scorpions - Tacoma\"\n  preload=\"none\"\n  accentColor=\"#FF0000\"\n  client:load\n/>\n\n![Scorpions](assets/blog/posts/live-music-in-my-life/IMG_2651.JPEG)\n![Scorpions](assets/blog/posts/live-music-in-my-life/IMG_2658.JPEG)\n![Scorpions](assets/blog/posts/live-music-in-my-life/IMG_2677.JPEG)\n![Scorpions](assets/blog/posts/live-music-in-my-life/IMG_2704.JPEG)\n\n## Paul McCartney\n\n### Tacoma Dome, Tacoma, WA\n\nI mean, who in the world would miss this show? It's basically the Beatles, right? :)) I don't know any songs by Paul McCartney, but maaaan, I enjoyed his performance so much! He's so very down-to-earth, self-aware, and - I'd never though I'd say this - funny. We were seated waaaaaaay far away from the stage so there's no photos or videos of the show.\n\n# 2023\n\n## Boombox\n\n### SoDo, Seattle, WA\n\nWouldn't miss it for the world. Got my green \"Zelensky\" t-shirts there, and got to sing along to \"Oi u luzi chervona kalyna\" with hundreds of Ukrainians around.\n\n<MuxPlayer\n  playbackId=\"81WhSTb02hwHuhopY2jFbi701buKpMLrKkXoypUMYifuM\"\n  style={{ aspectRatio: 16 / 9 }}\n  loading=\"viewport\"\n  thumbnailTime=\"24\"\n  title=\"Boombox - Kirkland\"\n  preload=\"none\"\n  accentColor=\"#FF0000\"\n  client:load\n/>\n\n## Okean Elzy\n\n### SoDo Showbox, Seattle, WA\n\nAnother band I hadn't seen live before.

Not in a sense that it was dull or uninspired but in a sense that we always go to see them when they are in the area. It was also the first show since they were officially and legally declared \"enemies of the state\" by Russia. The show was great, as always. This band just doesn't disappoint.\n\n<MuxPlayer\n  playbackId=\"QqSH3nEbu7GiKCBwB7jv025mic3lswHH3psPF01ir6o5w\"\n  style={{ aspectRatio: 16 / 9 }}\n  loading=\"viewport\"\n  thumbnailTime=\"24\"\n  title=\"Bi-2 - Seattle\"\n  preload=\"none\"\n  accentColor=\"#FF0000\"\n  client:load\n/>\n\n## Ed Sheeran\n\n### Lumen Field, Seattle, WA\n\nPersonally, I went to hear one song. And I did hear it :)) Along with many other songs, some of which I knew and liked. Our local artist Macklemore joined Ed for a surprise performance, which was great. The only downside of this show was that we finally got COVID and spent the next few days pretty sick.\n\n<MuxPlayer\n  playbackId=\"j1yKSbzzVndu016UtJIDm01mIkNCHbVK1eApwl4KUIHOg\"\n  style={{ aspectRatio: 16 / 9 }}\n  loading=\"viewport\"\n  thumbnailTime=\"24\"\n  title=\"Ed Sheeran - Seattle\"\n  preload=\"none\"\n  accentColor=\"#FF0000\"\n  client:load\n/>\n\nWith Macklemore\n\n<MuxPlayer\n  playbackId=\"QLPJlxNZA9N400GJIQ725Jm9y9yAf5B41BeIpBZPAk3c\"\n  style={{ aspectRatio: 16 / 9 }}\n  loading=\"viewport\"\n  thumbnailTime=\"24\"\n  title=\"Ed Sheeran with Macklemore - Seattle\"\n  preload=\"none\"\n  accentColor=\"#FF0000\"\n  client:load\n/>\n\n## Tom Odell\n\n### Showbox, Seattle, WA\n\nHelen took me to the show. I didn't know who Tom Odell was, and I didn't particularly enjoy his music. But a live show is a live show, and I enjoyed _that_.\n\n# 2024\n\n## Red Hot Chili Peppers\n\n### Gorge Amphitheatre, WA\n\nFirst time at the Gorge Amphitheatre, second time seeing RHCP live.

Can't help it. They had a 2-day set, with the songs I liked playing the day before. Still, objectively, it was a great performance by a legendary band, and I'm going to cherish this memory.\n\n<MuxPlayer\n  playbackId=\"00EwAC02GJ9WRFQICiiJV00naY62WavOpatAaUsH01Awjg4\"\n  style={{ aspectRatio: 16 / 9 }}\n  loading=\"viewport\"\n  thumbnailTime=\"24\"\n  title=\"Metallica - Seattle\"\n  preload=\"none\"\n  accentColor=\"#FF0000\"\n  client:load\n/>\n\n## Green Day\n\n### T-Mobile Park, Seattle, WA\n\nHere we go again! This time, the openers were \"Linda Linda\" and \"Rancid\", and the show itself was a celebration of the 20th anniversary of the American Idiot and the 30th anniversary of the Dookie. So, naturally, Green Day played both albums in their entirety with a few extra songs thrown in for good measure. 10/10 stars, would go again.\n\n<MuxPlayer\n  playbackId=\"DXrb02av4dnO7gBuzWTLx2M01N5MNzw6HtL4KyfsRlfEc\"\n  style={{ aspectRatio: 16 / 9 }}\n  loading=\"viewport\"\n  thumbnailTime=\"24\"\n  title=\"Green Day - Seattle\"\n  preload=\"none\"\n  accentColor=\"#FF0000\"\n  client:load\n/>\n\n## Jade Bird\n\n### McMenamins, Tacoma, WA\n\nPretty cool acustic show. [Zan Fiskum](https://www.zanfiskum.com/) opened for Jade Bird, and they even had a song together. I wasn't familiar with Zan's music, and I'm really happy that I discovered her at this Jade Bird's session.

The show left us with a feeling that the band was at work they didn't really like: they were there to hit specific notes, sing a set of lyrics at a certain volume, drum specific beats, and then get back to their lives. Not an enjoyeble experience.\n\n<MuxPlayer\n  playbackId=\"MGYFUmjKqOBk2g00DDa00800DKxBH8WJObtIuc2PyOzzAI\"\n  style={{ aspectRatio: 16 / 9 }}\n  loading=\"viewport\"\n  thumbnailTime=\"24\"\n  title=\"Mumiy Troll - Vancouver, BC\"\n  preload=\"none\"\n  accentColor=\"#FF0000\"\n  client:load\n/>\n\n## Linkin Park\n\n### Arlington, TX\n\nFinally, this.

Like, after I come back home, I felt so tired that my only thought was \"when would I be able to rest after this?\" This time was different: I came back home refreshed, somewhat rested, relaxed, and calm. And the thing is, it was just a bit longer than a weekend.\n\nA few months ago, my wife found a farm on San Juan island that offered camping on site. We thought it was a cool idea, and we booked our 4-night stay right away. We've been to San Juan briefly earlier this year, and wanted to explore it more, so it was a perfect setup.\n\nWe arrived late on Thursday: we took an 7:40 ferry from Anacortes. The ferry was late, yet the sailing was beautiful.\n\n![](assets/blog/posts/san-juan-island-weekend/504bebab4250c8d73fb298cb90456afec57ab842-4032x3024.avif)\n\nWe arrived around 10 pm in beautiful Friday Harbor. The weather was very mild, and everything around looked mysterious and truly gorgeous.\n\n![](assets/blog/posts/san-juan-island-weekend/b8d1e3303549f8d936969f2daf88e67cf68f60b8-4032x3024.avif)\n\nAfter a short drive from the port to the farm, we set up for the night at [Sweet Earth Farm](https://sweetearthfarm.com/farm-stays/)'s \"Madrone\" tent site.\n\n## Sweet Earth Farm\n\nI said we went camping on a remote farm on a remote island, but it was not the whole truth. The \"camping\" here is more of a \"glamping\": we were staying in a pre-set tent, with a real bed with a decent mattress, bedside tables, electricity and a fan.\n\n![](assets/blog/posts/san-juan-island-weekend/11286d5ea673355497bf6adfd83dbbd65a234911-4032x3024.avif)\n\nThe site itself was spacious and private. Our son decided to stay in his own tent, and there was enough space for that and then some.\n\n![](assets/blog/posts/san-juan-island-weekend/ed9378a1fa62947f62ac6db2cdc5bc5508378eb6-4032x3024.avif)\n\nThe site also included the kitchen with a gas stove, running water, utensils, and so forth.\n\n![](assets/blog/posts/san-juan-island-weekend/8845dcf8f0e370e2cd290a6a5ccc1636d95fb330-4032x3024.avif)\n![](assets/blog/posts/san-juan-island-weekend/a38e5ad0512cbb648e2ad785cab2eda3b36dbbb0-4032x3024.avif)\n\nSince we are campers with a lot of experience, we had everything with us to be entirely autonomous. Still, it was really nice to have a stove and running water!\n\n![](assets/blog/posts/san-juan-island-weekend/3d2dbc460a82c00f76593ac3fef18c6afdb4b55e-4032x3024.avif)\n\nThe farm grows everything from cucumbers and strawberries to lavender, and has chickens and ducks. Every morning we were greeted by a bunch of roosters declaring that it's a new day, which was pretty much the experience I was looking for.\n\nThe fact that we had a real bed in a spacious tent contributed a lot to being able to have truly restful sleep and waking up refreshed. The kitchen also removed a lot of morning anxieties and hustles contributing to a good start of the day.\n\n## San Juan Island\n\nThe island itself is a part of the San Juan Islands archipelago in the Salish Sea here in Washington. It's the largest of the islands and most developed and populated with roughly 7000 residents. It also has some really fun history, with the best known event being \"[The Pig War](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLq6GEiHqR8)\": once upon a time, the United States and Great Britain almost went to war over a dude shooting a pig (true story!). The two countries claimed the island and had military camps on it, and it got tense at times :)\n\n![](assets/blog/posts/san-juan-island-weekend/cb5c373371c6107b3ac62e930dae2fb0b6c88306-2268x4032.avif)\n![](assets/blog/posts/san-juan-island-weekend/092b480a150313ef46c8fbe2f4b676d98677e829-2268x4032.avif)\n\nThe island is comparatively large: it would take about an hour to circumvent it, yet you could drive along its length in about 30 minutes. We had 3 full days to explore the island, and it's just enough time to hit all the landmarks, some local farms, and have time to just chill.\n\n![](assets/blog/posts/san-juan-island-weekend/d0e4c3b4f578b9f2b3ec878a9139136147211aaa-4032x3024.avif)\n![](assets/blog/posts/san-juan-island-weekend/1e9a58476de4c79c0358fa10c2ea9d0cd35b55fd-4032x2268.avif)\n![](assets/blog/posts/san-juan-island-weekend/f5e8ab82843ea9de7d2b861448d5d61c4249d3d7-4032x3024.avif)\n\n## Friday Harbor\n\nFriday Harbor is the largest town on the island, its urban center. It has about 3000 residents, few museums, a lot of fine dining options, and a market. It's really cute, and has this small town feel to it, while also having real vacation-tourist vibe.\n\n![](assets/blog/posts/san-juan-island-weekend/b7a7ece3e4cd3059d5f8f82308c23a85e1cde7c2-4032x2268.avif)\n\nWhile we spent a bit of time in Friday Harbor, mostly shopping and dining, most of our time on the island we spent chilling on the beach and... chasing foxes!\n\n## Foxes\n\nFoxes are a feature of San Juan's. They are wild, they are everywhere, and they are not afraid of humans, most of the time.\n\nFoxes of San Juan Island\n\nAt first, we were super thrilled to see a wild fox, but as we spent more time away from crowds, we realized that these cuties are like squirrels on the mainland. It doesn't change the fact that it's entirely very cool meeting them everywhere!\n\n![](assets/blog/posts/san-juan-island-weekend/1ee461953412a687e00ed8bfd465c00193995552-4032x2268.avif)\n![](assets/blog/posts/san-juan-island-weekend/bc6cd2176aa0088f5247a8961824dcbd58b6d342-4032x2268.avif)\n![](assets/blog/posts/san-juan-island-weekend/5090c408f3c7f6e92a5d472daed0d53f67e4c6ab-4032x3024.avif)\n![](assets/blog/posts/san-juan-island-weekend/d818119ce13ea1668f800aba3783baedba9b633e-4032x3024.avif)\n![](assets/blog/posts/san-juan-island-weekend/ce636917bf82db38ec631943f7bf15c3aff1df8f-4032x3024.avif)\n![](assets/blog/posts/san-juan-island-weekend/f0259a467d01c8fc16ec8a900fda78e30c768242-3840x2160.avif)\n\n## The beach\n\nAs I mentioned earlier, we spent a lot of time on the beach. We found one that's isolated enough, not very popular and has some needed shade. Not giving it away, but locals and those who frequent San Juan will probably recognize it.\n\n![](assets/blog/posts/san-juan-island-weekend/9753d370c84984c7ba6fe35abfdb3aaf4f6bbd08-4032x2268.avif)\n![](assets/blog/posts/san-juan-island-weekend/1a09766bbeb960894a243e9623c06a6ff81a9776-4032x2268.avif)\n\nFinally, I had a few hours a day to just do nothing, think about nothing, and read my books. I've finished \"The Apollo Murders\", and can't be happier about just sitting on the beach reading a book.\n\n![](assets/blog/posts/san-juan-island-weekend/5c9ae3005d8ee98865e9d645b4be6cf873a0311a-4032x2268.avif)\n\nMy best guess is that this made the whole trip so relaxing and refreshing. We were never in a rush, we had all the time in the world to both explore and relax.\n\nOh, and speaking of beaches...\n\n![](assets/blog/posts/san-juan-island-weekend/749ff6356deac2a82eee39866d8872cb621ccf60-4032x2268.avif)\n\n## Local Farms\n\nAlong with chasing foxes, visiting historic landmarks, and dining in the heart of Friday Harbor, we also visited some of the local farms.\n\nThe first one was [Amaro Farm](https://amaro-farm.ueniweb.com/). They have some of the cutest sheep in the world!\n\n![](assets/blog/posts/san-juan-island-weekend/c18ab471a583aedc6de07ab6e6a8ae67f711556e-2268x4032.avif)\n![](assets/blog/posts/san-juan-island-weekend/9a11126385952a1d8c32e009dc743165dcc90a11-2268x4032.avif)\n\nAnother farm we stopped by was the [Pelindaba Lavender Farm](https://www.pelindabalavender.com/). On a clear sunny day, their lavender fields look absolutely fantastic!\n\n![](assets/blog/posts/san-juan-island-weekend/8516febef28094ade54dfcc10f860c9b495171c1-4032x2268.avif)\n![](assets/blog/posts/san-juan-island-weekend/d6d4dc03f9ed42356598739fe03564230f9611c0-4032x2268.avif)\n![](assets/blog/posts/san-juan-island-weekend/d2aea4f4dcb865977013b5730b17763a8eae699d-4032x2268.avif)\n\nAll in all, it was one of the nicest, most refreshing short vacations that we had in a while. Even the trip back on Monday was gorgeous.\n\n![](assets/blog/posts/san-juan-island-weekend/88aa42ac0033342a460520b8352fe532c4f4866b-4032x2268.avif)\n![](assets/blog/posts/san-juan-island-weekend/c487fe2ce6827966d0183a6c45fb8479d429ae42-4032x2268.avif)\n\n**10/10, would go again!**","src/content/blog/2022/08/13/22/san-juan-island-weekend.md",[2807,2808,2809,2810,2811,2812,2813,2814,2815,2816,2817,2818,2819,2820,2821,2822,2823,2824,2825,2826,2827,2828,2829,2830,2831,2832,2833,2834,2835,2836,2837],"assets/blog/posts/san-juan-island-weekend/504bebab4250c8d73fb298cb90456afec57ab842-4032x3024.avif","assets/blog/posts/san-juan-island-weekend/b8d1e3303549f8d936969f2daf88e67cf68f60b8-4032x3024.avif","assets/blog/posts/san-juan-island-weekend/11286d5ea673355497bf6adfd83dbbd65a234911-4032x3024.avif","assets/blog/posts/san-juan-island-weekend/ed9378a1fa62947f62ac6db2cdc5bc5508378eb6-4032x3024.avif","assets/blog/posts/san-juan-island-weekend/8845dcf8f0e370e2cd290a6a5ccc1636d95fb330-4032x3024.avif","assets/blog/posts/san-juan-island-weekend/a38e5ad0512cbb648e2ad785cab2eda3b36dbbb0-4032x3024.avif","assets/blog/posts/san-juan-island-weekend/3d2dbc460a82c00f76593ac3fef18c6afdb4b55e-4032x3024.avif","assets/blog/posts/san-juan-island-weekend/cb5c373371c6107b3ac62e930dae2fb0b6c88306-2268x4032.avif","assets/blog/posts/san-juan-island-weekend/092b480a150313ef46c8fbe2f4b676d98677e829-2268x4032.avif","assets/blog/posts/san-juan-island-weekend/d0e4c3b4f578b9f2b3ec878a9139136147211aaa-4032x3024.avif","assets/blog/posts/san-juan-island-weekend/1e9a58476de4c79c0358fa10c2ea9d0cd35b55fd-4032x2268.avif","assets/blog/posts/san-juan-island-weekend/f5e8ab82843ea9de7d2b861448d5d61c4249d3d7-4032x3024.avif","assets/blog/posts/san-juan-island-weekend/b7a7ece3e4cd3059d5f8f82308c23a85e1cde7c2-4032x2268.avif","assets/blog/posts/san-juan-island-weekend/1ee461953412a687e00ed8bfd465c00193995552-4032x2268.avif","assets/blog/posts/san-juan-island-weekend/bc6cd2176aa0088f5247a8961824dcbd58b6d342-4032x2268.avif","assets/blog/posts/san-juan-island-weekend/5090c408f3c7f6e92a5d472daed0d53f67e4c6ab-4032x3024.avif","assets/blog/posts/san-juan-island-weekend/d818119ce13ea1668f800aba3783baedba9b633e-4032x3024.avif","assets/blog/posts/san-juan-island-weekend/ce636917bf82db38ec631943f7bf15c3aff1df8f-4032x3024.avif","assets/blog/posts/san-juan-island-weekend/f0259a467d01c8fc16ec8a900fda78e30c768242-3840x2160.avif","assets/blog/posts/san-juan-island-weekend/9753d370c84984c7ba6fe35abfdb3aaf4f6bbd08-4032x2268.avif","assets/blog/posts/san-juan-island-weekend/1a09766bbeb960894a243e9623c06a6ff81a9776-4032x2268.avif","assets/blog/posts/san-juan-island-weekend/5c9ae3005d8ee98865e9d645b4be6cf873a0311a-4032x2268.avif","assets/blog/posts/san-juan-island-weekend/749ff6356deac2a82eee39866d8872cb621ccf60-4032x2268.avif","assets/blog/posts/san-juan-island-weekend/c18ab471a583aedc6de07ab6e6a8ae67f711556e-2268x4032.avif","assets/blog/posts/san-juan-island-weekend/9a11126385952a1d8c32e009dc743165dcc90a11-2268x4032.avif","assets/blog/posts/san-juan-island-weekend/8516febef28094ade54dfcc10f860c9b495171c1-4032x2268.avif","assets/blog/posts/san-juan-island-weekend/d6d4dc03f9ed42356598739fe03564230f9611c0-4032x2268.avif","assets/blog/posts/san-juan-island-weekend/d2aea4f4dcb865977013b5730b17763a8eae699d-4032x2268.avif","assets/blog/posts/san-juan-island-weekend/88aa42ac0033342a460520b8352fe532c4f4866b-4032x2268.avif","assets/blog/posts/san-juan-island-weekend/c487fe2ce6827966d0183a6c45fb8479d429ae42-4032x2268.avif","@assets/blog/posts/san-juan-island-weekend/bc6cd2176aa0088f5247a8961824dcbd58b6d342-4032x2268.avif","c6a98f5f4d6e30fe",{html:2840,metadata:2841},"<p>It’s pretty funny that for the longest time my “vacations” were exhausting.

I remember hanging out with friends at their dorm in Moscow, turning volume up whenever _In the End_ or _Numb_ was playing on ULTRA; I remember posting on LiveJournal and setting \"Current Music\" to Mike Shinoda's Fort Minor _Where'd You Go_. Unlike my spouse, though, I wasn't a hardcode fan of LP, yet with her influence, I've been listening to them a lot more for years.\n\nIn 2017, LP released a new album _One More Light_ and announced a world tour. There was no way we'd miss it: neither my wife nor I have ever seen LP live. So we've got our tickets sometime in spring and were waiting for the show with great anticipation and excitement.\n\n![Three Linkin Park concert tickets for the One More Light World Tour at KeyArena in Seattle Center on October 14, 2017 at 7:30 PM. The tickets are arranged in a fan shape on a reflective surface.](assets/blog/posts/linkin-park-is-back/IMG_0084.JPEG)\n\nBut some things are just not meant to be. On July 20, 2017, LP's lead singer [Chester Bennington](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chester_Bennington) tragically died of suicide. Throughout his life, Chester struggled depression, addiction, and mental health issues stemming from being abused as a child, and he was hit hard by the tragic death of his good friend [Chris Cornell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Cornell) of Soundgarden. Another contributing factor was the fact that a roudy and loud chunk of LP fanbase was really nasty about the new album, which Chester reportedly took to heart.\n\nOn July 29, 2017, my wife and I organized a memorial in Centennial Park in Seattle. A few dozen people showed up, and we were all very emotional.\n\n![A memorial setup for Chester Bennington at a stone monument. There are framed photos of Chester, flowers, candles arranged in a heart shape, and balloons.

The messages are tributes and thank you notes addressed to  Chester Bennington of Linkin Park](assets/blog/posts/linkin-park-is-back/IMG_0163.JPEG)\n\nI've made a video of the event, and it's available on YouTube:\n\n<YouTube id=\"UXNRezHLPmE\" className=\"mx-auto min-w-full rounded-md py-5\" />\n\nLater in 2017, a huge memorial concert was held in Los Angeles, with many Chester and LP friends singing Linking Park songs — from _Blink-182_, Korn, and _System of a Down_ to _Machine Gun Kelly_, _One Ok Rock_, and _Alanis Morissette_. We had a chance to go but chickened out. We've regretted it ever since.\n\n<YouTube id=\"9VoLHdADma8\" className=\"mx-auto min-w-full rounded-md py-5\" />\n\nIn 2018, we went to San Francisco for [Mike Shinoda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Shinoda) solo show, mostly to get some sort of closure. At the time, I thought that that's as close to LP concert that I'd ever get.\n\n![A concert performance scene bathed in purple light.

The countdown ended anticlimactically with a bunch of glitchy effects that happened at 9:05 minutes after the countdown turned into _count up_ (or, as normal people would say, _timer_.) Another glitch happened at 1:35:00 or 95 minutes, then another at 9 hours and 05 minutes. The rumours turned insane, and the great reveal was that on 9/5 (see what they did there?), a secret event will take place in Los Angeles. Tickets were distrubuted only amongst premium members of [LP Undeground](https://lpunderground.com/), Linkin Parks's official fan club: every member was entered into a raffle and those who won would be invited to the event (free of charge). There was no other way to get the invitation; tickets were not resellable, and there was no way to buy them.\n\nWell, my wife won the invitation. We got airplane tickets to LA to fly in in the morning and return in the evening. While this was an experience in itself, what followed was a bit of a shock, in a good way. I dropped Helen off at the Universal Studios parking lot, and went to the [theme park](https://www.universalstudioshollywood.com/web/en/us) (I mean, what else do you do in LA when your timeline is unclear and you're waiting for somebody to return from a secret event at an undisclosed location?!).\n\n![A selfie of a middle-aged man with grey hair and beard, wearing sunglasses and a grey t-shirt, smiling at the camera (that's me!).

Yay!\n\n![A dramatic scene from a theme park stunt show, featuring a large set of dilapidated buildings. A controlled explosion and fire erupt from one structure, with fireworks shooting into the sky above.](assets/blog/posts/linkin-park-is-back/IMG_4554.JPEG)\n\nAfter a bunch of rides at my other favorite attraction, the Jurassic Park, it was almost time for the \"secret event\" to start. By that time, I knew that fans were shuttled by like 40 busses to Warner Studios, which meant (almost certainly!) we'll at least get some new music. The live show on YouTube was showing \"The show will begin shortly\" message, and at 3 pm on the dot, things started to unfold very quickly. I was perched on a tiny bench, with my phone in hand, in the shade behind the Jurassic Park cafe, amongst thousands of people just enjoying their day at the park.\n\nWell, we've got what we dreamed about. The live show opened with a new Linkin Park song \"Emptiness Machine\", during which we were introduced to the band's new vocalist [Emily Armstrong](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emily_Armstrong_(musician)>). Admittedly, I was wearing my bone conducting headphones and it was very, very noisy around me, but I got genuine goosebumps when she appeared on stage for the first time: her voice, singing manner, drive - it felt like such a natural and organic fit!\n\nPhotos below are from the show, made by Helen.\n\n![A close-up of Emily Armstrong, Linkin Park's new lead singer, performing on stage. She has long blonde hair and is wearing a mesh top, singing passionately into a microphone while crouching on the stage.](assets/blog/posts/linkin-park-is-back/IMG_3879.JPEG)\n\nNaturally, the audience consisted of the most loyal fans of Linkin Park, and they went wild and stayed wild for the whole show, which was a ride to say the least. I'm so extremely happy that Helen got to witness this historic event and be a part of it.\n\n![A dimly lit concert stage illuminated by blue lights.

Apparently, Emily is a member of the Church of Scientology cult. It was also reported that she supported Danny Masterson during his trial for sexual abuse. She's also a woman. And also she's not Chester. Oh, and the new song doesn't sound like Linkin Park. All of this bullshit, you know?\n\nRemember \"roudy and loud\" chunk of LP fanbase? Some of the same people who were screaming \"Linking Park doesn't sound like Linkin Park\" after every new album after Meteora was released? The ones who kept upsetting Chester and the rest of the band? Yep, they were the same people. So here's my take on it: not only is Emily not an active scientologist (she was born into the cult, _not_ joined it), she absolutely broke all ties with Masterson as soon as evidence at the trial showed he was a rapist. She is not Chester because nobody is Chester, duh. Yet her style, voice, and vibe is so Linkin Park, I can't even. And just imagine stepping into the role of LP's vocalist, during a LIVE SHOW broadcast in Time Square and everywhere else. Mad respect.\n\n`@rosnovsky@lounge.town:113087355372598538`\n\nP.S.

Here's how I did it.",["Date","2024-02-15T00:00:00.000Z"],"# Why\n\nLet me start here so that there are no misunderstandings down the road. I've been running a small instance of Mastodon for just over a year. It was hosted in Digital Ocean, and it worked very well. There were two key reasons to migrate, though:\n\n- Cost of hosting on Digital Ocean\n- Learning opportunity\n\n![Containers FTW!](assets/blog/posts/migrating-mastodon-instance-to-k8s/containers.jpg)\n\n## Cost of hosting on Digital Ocean\n\nBefore the migration, I was paying around $60-$80 per month for the Droplet I was using to host [Lounge.town](https://lounge.town). In a way, it's my own fault that the cost ballooned so much: it started as a fairly reasonable 20-30 bucks per month, but as influx of users just kept coming monthly, I (thought that I) had to keep upgrading the Droplet to keep up with the demand. As soon as I'd got a notification from Digital Ocean that CPU usage exceeded 80%, or RAM was running high, or disk utilization was approaching 90%, I'd upgrade to the next tier. This happened a few times, and before I knew it, I was paying $80+ per month for a Droplet that was running this one service.\n\nNow, [Lounge.town](https://lounge.town) is a smaller instance. At one point it did have over 1500 active users but at this point, it's down to about 100 people who use it daily. It's funded entirely by yours truly, and donations do not really make any dent in the cost of running it (I collected something like $25 in total in 2023). So, I had to find a way to cut costs.\n\n## Learning opportunity\n\nI've been working with Kubernetes at work for a few months, and got a pretty good grasp of how it works and how I may benefit from using it myself. I've got a ton of little side projects (including this blog) that require some sort of hosting. Managing and juggling multiple Docker containers, each with its own configuration, is not fun. Deploying whatever it is that I'm playing with this weekend to Kubernetes, on the other hand, is a breeze. Well, I shouldn't say \"breeze\" - it's still quite a bit of work, but every time I do it, I learn something new. With this in mind, I've [migrated this blog](/blog/vercel-to-kubernetes) to a small cluster I've set up on [Hostinger VPS](https://hostinger.com/?REFERRALCODE=1ART641) (referral link, you get a discount and I get one too!). Now, what's left is to migrate [Lounge.town](https://lounge.town) to Kubernetes as well.\n\n# What\n\nMastodon is not a single binary you can just run wherever you want and be done with it. It has multiple moving parts, including a database, a web server, a streaming server, and a background worker. It's a bit of a pain to set up, but once it's running, it's fairly easy to maintain, even on bare metal.\n\n`Docker compose` makes running a Mastodon instance as painless as it gets. With a single command, you can spin up all the necessary services, restart them to upgrade, perform maintenance, and so on. It's a bit more complicate than this, but you get the idea.\n\nNow, Kubernetes is... shall I say, a bit _different_? It's an entire world of stuff, from `configMaps` to `clusterIssuers`. It can take care of pretty much _literally_ everything, from networking to storage to security. But in no way is it simple. Even when you're experienced with `k8s`, there are still pitfalls to be aware of, and things to watch out for. Managed services (think [EKS](https://www.amazonaws.cn/en/eks/) and alike) take care of some of the complexity, but they are **EXPENSIVE**. And I don't mean \"a bit more expensive than running a single EC2 instance\" expensive. I mean \"I could buy a car for the price of running this cluster for a year\" expensive. Sure, you can cut some costs here and there, but it's still a good chunk of change, and there's way less predictability (cloud plans are purposefully confusing and hard to understand, not mention to estimate bills).\n\nSo here we are, a cluster of some sort is already up and running, most rough edges are smoothed out, and I'm ready to migrate [Lounge.town](https://lounge.town) to it.\n\n# How\n\nThere were multiple ways that I've considered. Whatever path I'd take had to:\n\n- Be fully reversible (if I screwed up, I must be able to roll back to the old setup)\n- Not require any downtime (or as little as possible)\n- Not affect actual Lounge Town residents in any way\n- Be as simple as possible\n\nI've considered a few options.\n\n## Do things by hand\n\nWrite manifests by hand for each service, deploy them one by one, make sure everything is in order, then just switch the DNS to point to the new cluster. In many ways, that would've been the best option: I get to learn everything there is to learn, know _exactly_ what I'm doing, and have full control over everything. This option, unfortunately, is surprisingly time-consuming (I tried!), and very (and I mean VERY) error prone. I still think I should do it at some point, but not for this migration.\n\n> > By \"by hand\" I mean writing raw `YAML` manifests or writing manifests with `kustomize` and similar tools. It's a very involved process, albeit to be fair it's not necessarily _entirely_ manual.\n\n## Use Helm\n\nHelm is a package manager for Kubernetes. It's a bit like `apt` or `pacman` or `brew` for Kubernetes. Essentially, you \"install\" whatever it is you need to deploy, provide Helm with values it should use for the deployment (\"deployment\" in general, not Kubernetes `deployment`!) and Helm takes care of the rest. It's really easy, most if not all complexity is abstracted away and hidden from you, but you still get to configure things the way you need within the given Helm chart constraints that is. You lose a lot of control (unless you're willing to dive into the chart itself and manually modify it to your liking), there's quite a bit of \"magic\" involved, and it's not always clear what's going on under the hood. But if you trust the chart maintainer, it's not easy to screw things up.\n\n## Use a combination of both\n\nThis would've been ideal at first, but it could've easily turned into a horror story. Say, I could've used Helm to deploy the database (the chart for this is well-maintaned), use `kustomize` for most other services, and then manually glue everything together. However, I could see how this could've turned into a mess very quickly, and I didn't want to risk it (just think about troubleshooting when something goes wrong!).\n\nAt the end of the day, I decided to go with the [semi-official Helm chart for Mastodon](https://github.com/mastodon/chart). I mean, it's official in the sense that it's created by the Mastodon team, but not so official when it comes to its maintenance, updates, support, etc. The `values.yaml` file is a bit of a mess, and it's not always clear why certain value is there (and other values are not). It also appears to be a bit neglected, but that's open source for ya :)\n\nAnywho, I went ahead:\n\n1. Set up a new namespace for the Mastodon instance. You can do it when you install the Helm chart (there's a CLI option for that)\n2. Updated `values.yaml` with what I thought were sensible values.\n3. Prior to deploying the chart, I've created a `dev` domain where I could try things first and make sure everything works.\n4. Deploying the chart was as simple as a single `helm install` command (with some flags and options, of course).\n\n![Status log of the migration](assets/blog/posts/migrating-mastodon-instance-to-k8s/status-log.png)\n\nImmediately, I've got all the things humming: a web server, a streaming server, a background worker, and a database, all this good stuff: I had a newly installed, clean, brand new Mastodon instance. Great, this worked!\n\nNext step was to actually _migrate_ the data without disrupting anything. This was a bit more involved: it required migrating the database, the media (which is stored in an S3-compatible storage), and other configuration bits and pieces. I've done it in a few steps:\n\n- provided the new instance with secrets, API keys, and other credentials so that it could pretend to be the old instance when reaching out for, say, some avatars or whatever.\n- paused the old instance, made a backup of the database, and then restored it on the new instance\n- tested everything to make sure it works through a local port forwarding (there are some quirks with Mastodon that make it hard to test things without a proper domain name)\n\nAt this point, I was pretty confident that everything was working. I let the instance to run for a bit, and then switched the DNS to point to the new cluster.\n\nSurprisingly, everything worked! I mean, there were a few hiccups here and there, but nothing major. The biggest issue was with media caching and images not showing up unless you hard-refresh the page. Aside from this, everything was working as expected. One small thing that is still missing to this day is media cache proxying: I've yet to figure out how to make it work with the new setup.\n\nAs a funny side effect of this whole migration, I've discovered that the media storage had 1.4 TB of cached media just sitting there, doing nothing. I've cleaned it up, and now it's down to a more reasonable 165 GB. The cleanup took a few days, but it was worth it.\n\nBefore:\n![Before](assets/blog/posts/migrating-mastodon-instance-to-k8s/before.png)\n\nAfter:\n![After](assets/blog/posts/migrating-mastodon-instance-to-k8s/after.png)\n\n# Now what?\n\nNow I'm paying $300 per year for the entire instance (down from almost $1K!).

I’ve been running a small instance of Mastodon for just over a year. It was hosted in Digital Ocean, and it worked very well. There were two key reasons to migrate, though:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Cost of hosting on Digital Ocean</li>\n<li>Learning opportunity</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img __ASTRO_IMAGE_=\"{&#x22;src&#x22;:&#x22;assets/blog/posts/migrating-mastodon-instance-to-k8s/containers.jpg&#x22;,&#x22;alt&#x22;:&#x22;Containers FTW!&#x22;,&#x22;index&#x22;:0}\"></p>\n<h2 id=\"cost-of-hosting-on-digital-ocean\">Cost of hosting on Digital Ocean</h2>\n<p>Before the migration, I was paying around $60-$80 per month for the Droplet I was using to host <a href=\"https://lounge.town\">Lounge.town</a>. In a way, it’s my own fault that the cost ballooned so much: it started as a fairly reasonable 20-30 bucks per month, but as influx of users just kept coming monthly, I (thought that I) had to keep upgrading the Droplet to keep up with the demand. As soon as I’d got a notification from Digital Ocean that CPU usage exceeded 80%, or RAM was running high, or disk utilization was approaching 90%, I’d upgrade to the next tier. This happened a few times, and before I knew it, I was paying $80+ per month for a Droplet that was running this one service.</p>\n<p>Now, <a href=\"https://lounge.town\">Lounge.town</a> is a smaller instance. At one point it did have over 1500 active users but at this point, it’s down to about 100 people who use it daily. It’s funded entirely by yours truly, and donations do not really make any dent in the cost of running it (I collected something like $25 in total in 2023). So, I had to find a way to cut costs.</p>\n<h2 id=\"learning-opportunity\">Learning opportunity</h2>\n<p>I’ve been working with Kubernetes at work for a few months, and got a pretty good grasp of how it works and how I may benefit from using it myself. I’ve got a ton of little side projects (including this blog) that require some sort of hosting. Managing and juggling multiple Docker containers, each with its own configuration, is not fun. Deploying whatever it is that I’m playing with this weekend to Kubernetes, on the other hand, is a breeze. Well, I shouldn’t say “breeze” - it’s still quite a bit of work, but every time I do it, I learn something new. With this in mind, I’ve <a href=\"/blog/vercel-to-kubernetes\">migrated this blog</a> to a small cluster I’ve set up on <a href=\"https://hostinger.com/?REFERRALCODE=1ART641\">Hostinger VPS</a> (referral link, you get a discount and I get one too!). Now, what’s left is to migrate <a href=\"https://lounge.town\">Lounge.town</a> to Kubernetes as well.</p>\n<h1 id=\"what\">What</h1>\n<p>Mastodon is not a single binary you can just run wherever you want and be done with it. It has multiple moving parts, including a database, a web server, a streaming server, and a background worker. It’s a bit of a pain to set up, but once it’s running, it’s fairly easy to maintain, even on bare metal.</p>\n<p><code>Docker compose</code> makes running a Mastodon instance as painless as it gets. With a single command, you can spin up all the necessary services, restart them to upgrade, perform maintenance, and so on. It’s a bit more complicate than this, but you get the idea.</p>\n<p>Now, Kubernetes is… shall I say, a bit <em>different</em>? It’s an entire world of stuff, from <code>configMaps</code> to <code>clusterIssuers</code>. It can take care of pretty much <em>literally</em> everything, from networking to storage to security. But in no way is it simple. Even when you’re experienced with <code>k8s</code>, there are still pitfalls to be aware of, and things to watch out for. Managed services (think <a href=\"https://www.amazonaws.cn/en/eks/\">EKS</a> and alike) take care of some of the complexity, but they are <strong>EXPENSIVE</strong>. And I don’t mean “a bit more expensive than running a single EC2 instance” expensive. I mean “I could buy a car for the price of running this cluster for a year” expensive. Sure, you can cut some costs here and there, but it’s still a good chunk of change, and there’s way less predictability (cloud plans are purposefully confusing and hard to understand, not mention to estimate bills).</p>\n<p>So here we are, a cluster of some sort is already up and running, most rough edges are smoothed out, and I’m ready to migrate <a href=\"https://lounge.town\">Lounge.town</a> to it.</p>\n<h1 id=\"how\">How</h1>\n<p>There were multiple ways that I’ve considered.

Now that this site runs on [Astro](https://astro.build), and my social networking happens exclusively at [Lounge.town](https://lounge.town/@rosnovsky) on Mastodon, it got me thinking about bridging the two. When I was writing about [migrating Lounge.town to Kubernetes](/blog/migrating-mastodon-instance-to-kubernetes), I really wanted to embed some of my mastodon posts but there were no good options to do so. So I've built one.\n\n![Astro Mastodon](assets/blog/posts/astro-mastodon/integration-live.png)\n\n## A tale of `astro-mastodon`\n\nHow do you build a thing when you don’t even know where to begin?\n\n> Well, you begin with what you **do** know.\n\nIt's not specific to software development; it's a fairly good framework in general.\n\n### Component in `MDX` maybe?\n\nI started with what I knew. I knew that you can use custom components in [`MDX`](https://mdxjs.com/) files, and that these components get rendered on the page when it loads:\n\n```markdown\n---\ntitle: some frontmatter\n---\n\nimport { Component } from '@/components'\n\n<Component prop=\"some prop\" />\n```\n\nIt works, of course. But there are multiple problems with this approach:\n\n- it's client-side so you lose benefits of SSR. It sucks.\n- in Astro, it also requires [`client:load`](https://docs.astro.build/en/reference/directives-reference/#clientload) directive, e.g. `<Component prop=\"some prop\" client:load />`. Hard to remember, it sucks.\n- an extra request on page load to some instance running on a Raspberry Pi in someone's basement could make page load time painfully slow\n- this approach only works in `MDX` and doesn't work in plain markdown\n- layout shift, loading indicator, runtime errors... quite a few foot-guns readily available\n\nBut what's the great advantage of this approach? I know it, and it works. So that's where I started.\n\n### `remark` plugin maybe?\n\nHow do I work around all of the problems listed above? Let me solve the biggest one for me personally: I've got a lot of posts in plain markdown, and it's unacceptible that this thing only works with `MDX`. How can I make it work with markdown?\n\nI was aware of [`remark`](https://remark.js.org/) plugins that allow you to modify how markdown is transformed and rendered, but I had no clue what they are exactly, how they work, and how to create one. Knowing _exactly_ what you don't know is a great place to be: you just go and learn!\n\nI ended up with a rather simple `remark` plugin. It walks the node tree of a post, looks for a particular pattern (in this case, anything that looks something like **@username@instance.domain:postId**), and replaces such nodes with an embedded card with post information. It happens at build time, doesn't require you to remember specific syntax, has no `import` boilerplate, prevents layout shifting, entirely SSR. Perfect, so many problems solved! It works great!\n\nUntil it doesn't.\n\nApparently, `remark` plugins have to by synchronous. And my little plugin does a few things asynchroneously: it fetches post information from an instance, which requires an `async` `fetch` request. Well, crap. If I provide the plugin with post data by the time it runs, it does what it's supposed to. Otherwise, if I try to fetch the data when it runs, the plugin fails (it can't wait for the data to come back from the interwebs).\n\nAll right. Ok. Ok. So, I need to pre-fetch data about mastodon posts beforehand, and then provide the plugin with it. All right. Got it. Cool, cool, cool. But how?\n\n### Astro `integration` perhaps?\n\nOk, now that we've tumbled down this rabbit hole, let's see if we can combine the `remark` plugin with some Astro magic. I mean, Astro _builds_ the website, it _has_ to have a way of injecting custom functions at build time! And it sure does: [integrations](https://docs.astro.build/en/reference/integrations-reference/) offer a way to use lifecycle hooks! Exactly what I need! I'm going to use a hook to generate a list of all Mastodon links I can find in markdown or `mdx` files, then fetch all the information about these posts that I need, store it temporarily on disk, and let Astro do its thing - build the website. As it builds it, the `remark` plugin will _already_ have access to the pre-fetched data and it should be happy!\n\nBelieve it or not, but that's in essense, the entirety of [`astro-mastodon`](https://npmjs.org/package/astro-mastodon) package. It collects \"mentions\", determines if they produce valid Mastodon links, checks whether these links actually resolve to Mastodon posts, fetches posts data, and stores it on disk. Then the plugin just renders this data into a nice embedded card like this one:\n\n`@rosnovsky@lounge.town:111994284450336426`\n\n## What's next?\n\nThe card above, as you can see, does indeed require some tender loving care. It's not as _nice_ as I want it to be, and there are multiple problems with it.\n\nBut for a quick (and solo) hackathon project, it's not too bad. The biggest problems that remain are:\n\n- proper hot reloading in `dev` mode (now it just restarts the server, which is not ideal at all.)\n- caching of already pre-fetched data (it has to be smart: people update posts, number of replies change, but re-downloading hundreds of Mastodon posts on every build is, again, not ideal.)\n- an option to enable the embedded card component to work with any Astro renderer (React, Preact, Svelte, Vue, etc.)\n- a way to render custom emoji. Custom emoji is a huge thing on the Fediverse, I have to be able to show them off!\n- a nice way to render media. Mastodon cards can include links, images, video, audio, OpenGraph preview cards, etc. I need to make all these render nicely. And I mean _really_ nicely.\n- Make it possible to properly \"mention\" people inline and embed profile cards.\n- Embed cards for other ActivityPub platforms (PeerTube, FunkyWhale, Pixelfed, etc.)\n\nThe good news is that with a fairly solid foundation, I can just iterate over these things, making small improvements here and there until I can tackle the big stuff. All in all, I'm very happy with how this hackathon project turned out :)\n\n[![astro-mastodon](https://opengraph.githubassets.com/64ba1c409cde8f7e6bc0ad7d7dc41d9ad3f4e8bd07d2907c01728f6358f9055c/rosnovsky/astro-mastodon)](https://github.com/rosnovsky/astro-mastodon)","src/content/blog/2024/02/25/building-astro-mastodon-library.md",[2939,2940],"assets/blog/posts/astro-mastodon/integration-live.png","@assets/blog/covers/astro-mastodon.webp","a38cfd427e90cb31",{html:2943,metadata:2944},"<p>After I was laid off earlier this month (I promise, I will post about it eventually), I figured that it’s perfect time to <a href=\"/blog/resume-automation\">have some fun</a>.</p>\n<p>It also just so happened that I’ve created a Slack group for those of us who were laid off, and somehow this group turned into a place for OG Auth0 folks to hang out - for those who’re still employed by Okta, <em>and</em> for those who moved on long time ago.</p>\n<p>And it’s entirely natural that one of the first orders of business happen to be a hackathon.

Then the plugin just renders this data into a nice embedded card like this one:</p>\n<p></p><aside class=\"card w-full\"><div class=\"card-content\"><div class=\"card-heading\"><div class=\"card-title\"><a href=\"https://lounge.town/@rosnovsky\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"no-underline\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><div class=\"w-14 h-14 mx-auto\"><img src=\"https://s3.us-west-1.wasabisys.com/lounge-town/accounts/avatars/109/363/435/781/395/161/original/a5032cbee1588e41.jpeg\" alt=\"Art 🏳️‍⚧️🏳️‍🌈✊🏿🇺🇦🇵🇸\" width=\"100\" height=\"100\" class=\"border-2 m-0 border-violet-700 object-cover w-full rounded-full\"></div></a><div class=\"user-info w-full flex flex-col pl-0 sm:pl-3 mx-auto\"><a href=\"https://lounge.town/@rosnovsky\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" class=\"pl-0 sm:pl-3\"><div class=\"mx-auto font-bold\">Art 🏳️‍⚧️🏳️‍🌈✊🏿🇺🇦🇵🇸</div><div class=\"mx-auto text-sm my-0\">@<!-- -->rosnovsky</div></a></div></div><div class=\"mastodon-logo\"><svg width=\"32px\" height=\"32px\" class=\"icon-tabler\" viewBox=\"-9 0 274 274\" version=\"1.1\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" preserveAspectRatio=\"xMidYMid\"><g><path d=\"M249.874103,164.084793 C246.121107,183.392442 216.260831,204.522765 181.966269,208.61788 C164.083135,210.751705 146.475762,212.712995 127.700462,211.851797 C96.9952088,210.444977 72.7666374,204.522765 72.7666374,204.522765 C72.7666374,207.511889 72.9509692,210.357972 73.3196328,213.019724 C77.3115222,243.322396 103.36719,245.137696 128.048481,245.984147 C152.959817,246.836498 175.141568,239.842212 175.141568,239.842212 L176.164978,262.363134 C176.164978,262.363134 158.740462,271.719816 127.700462,273.440737 C110.584149,274.381567 89.33143,273.010138 64.5778816,266.458249 C10.8916144,252.248479 1.65880329,195.021567 0.246084399,136.955576 C-0.184514679,119.715392 0.080923109,103.458802 0.080923109,89.8624885 C0.080923109,30.4870046 38.9837803,13.0831336 38.9837803,13.0831336 C58.5996328,4.07447005 92.258619,0.286082949 127.250693,0 L128.110416,0 C163.10249,0.286082949 196.783596,4.07447005 216.397974,13.0831336 C216.397974,13.0831336 255.299356,30.4870046 255.299356,89.8624885 C255.299356,89.8624885 255.787467,133.670046 249.874103,164.084793\" fill=\"currentColor\"></path><path d=\"M209.412536,94.4687189 L209.412536,166.362544 L180.929587,166.362544 L180.929587,96.5818986 C180.929587,81.8722212 174.740462,74.4060461 162.360739,74.4060461 C148.672997,74.4060461 141.812905,83.2628203 141.812905,100.775816 L141.812905,138.970839 L113.498066,138.970839 L113.498066,100.775816 C113.498066,83.2628203 106.636499,74.4060461 92.9487572,74.4060461 C80.5690337,74.4060461 74.3799093,81.8722212 74.3799093,96.5818986 L74.3799093,166.362544 L45.89696,166.362544 L45.89696,94.4687189 C45.89696,79.7752627 49.6381581,68.0989493 57.1529968,59.460424 C64.9023056,50.8218986 75.050877,46.3935115 87.6488494,46.3935115 C102.224333,46.3935115 113.262121,51.9957235 120.560186,63.2016221 L127.654748,75.0947097 L134.750785,63.2016221 C142.047375,51.9957235 153.085163,46.3935115 167.662121,46.3935115 C180.258619,46.3935115 190.40719,50.8218986 198.157974,59.460424 C205.671338,68.0989493 209.412536,79.7752627 209.412536,94.4687189\" fill=\"#FFFFFF\"></path></g></svg></div></div><div class=\"w-full my-6\"><div class=\"card-contents\"><p>This is a post of <a rel=\"tag\" href=\"https://lounge.town/tags/gratitude\">#gratitude</a> to <a href=\"https://hachyderm.io/@molly0xfff\">@molly0xfff</a>, who single-handedly just turned yours truly into a <a rel=\"tag\" href=\"https://lounge.town/tags/wikipedia\">#wikipedia</a> editor.

It’s not as <em>nice</em> as I want it to be, and there are multiple problems with it.</p>\n<p>But for a quick (and solo) hackathon project, it’s not too bad. The biggest problems that remain are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>proper hot reloading in <code>dev</code> mode (now it just restarts the server, which is not ideal at all.)</li>\n<li>caching of already pre-fetched data (it has to be smart: people update posts, number of replies change, but re-downloading hundreds of Mastodon posts on every build is, again, not ideal.)</li>\n<li>an option to enable the embedded card component to work with any Astro renderer (React, Preact, Svelte, Vue, etc.)</li>\n<li>a way to render custom emoji. Custom emoji is a huge thing on the Fediverse, I have to be able to show them off!</li>\n<li>a nice way to render media. Mastodon cards can include links, images, video, audio, OpenGraph preview cards, etc. I need to make all these render nicely. And I mean <em>really</em> nicely.</li>\n<li>Make it possible to properly “mention” people inline and embed profile cards.</li>\n<li>Embed cards for other ActivityPub platforms (PeerTube, FunkyWhale, Pixelfed, etc.)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The good news is that with a fairly solid foundation, I can just iterate over these things, making small improvements here and there until I can tackle the big stuff. All in all, I’m very happy with how this hackathon project turned out :)</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/rosnovsky/astro-mastodon\"><img src=\"https://opengraph.githubassets.com/64ba1c409cde8f7e6bc0ad7d7dc41d9ad3f4e8bd07d2907c01728f6358f9055c/rosnovsky/astro-mastodon\" alt=\"astro-mastodon\"></a></p>",{headings:2945,imagePaths:2959,frontmatter:2960},[2946,2949,2952,2955,2958],{depth:196,slug:2947,text:2948},"a-tale-of-astro-mastodon","A tale of astro-mastodon",{depth:199,slug:2950,text:2951},"component-in-mdx-maybe","Component in MDX maybe?",{depth:199,slug:2953,text:2954},"remark-plugin-maybe","remark plugin maybe?",{depth:199,slug:2956,text:2957},"astro-integration-perhaps","Astro integration perhaps?",{depth:196,slug:465,text:1451},[2939],{title:2931,publishDate:2961,category:130,description:2934,image:2962,minutesRead:236},["Date","2024-02-25T00:00:00.000Z"],{src:2940,alt:23},"2024/02/25/building-astro-mastodon-library.md"];
