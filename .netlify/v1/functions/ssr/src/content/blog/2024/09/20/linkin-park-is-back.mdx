Linkin Park has been a part of my life for well over 20 years now. I remember hanging out with friends at their dorm in Moscow, turning volume up whenever _In the End_ or _Numb_ was playing on ULTRA; I remember posting on LiveJournal and setting "Current Music" to Mike Shinoda's Fort Minor _Where'd You Go_. Unlike my spouse, though, I wasn't a hardcode fan of LP, yet with her influence, I've been listening to them a lot more for years.

In 2017, LP released a new album _One More Light_ and announced a world tour. There was no way we'd miss it: neither my wife nor I have ever seen LP live. So we've got our tickets sometime in spring and were waiting for the show with great anticipation and excitement.

But some things are just not meant to be. On July 20, 2017, LP's lead singer [Chester Bennington](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chester_Bennington) tragically died of suicide. Throughout his life, Chester struggled depression, addiction, and mental health issues stemming from being abused as a child, and he was hit hard by the tragic death of his good friend [Chris Cornell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Cornell) of Soundgarden. Another contributing factor was the fact that a roudy and loud chunk of LP fanbase was really nasty about the new album, which Chester reportedly took to heart.

On July 29, 2017, my wife and I organized a memorial in Centennial Park in Seattle. A few dozen people showed up, and we were all very emotional.

I've made a video of the event, and it's available on YouTube:

Later in 2017, a huge memorial concert was held in Los Angeles, with many Chester and LP friends singing Linking Park songs ‚Äî from _Blink-182_, Korn, and _System of a Down_ to _Machine Gun Kelly_, _One Ok Rock_, and _Alanis Morissette_. We had a chance to go but chickened out. We've regretted it ever since.

In 2018, we went to San Francisco for [Mike Shinoda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Shinoda) solo show, mostly to get some sort of closure. At the time, I thought that that's as close to LP concert that I'd ever get.

I've been following the band all these years even though it was uncler if there was a band to follow... until late August 2024.

## Linkin Park is back!

At the end of August 2024, a strange countown from 100 hours appeared on [Linkin Park website](https://linkinpark.com). The countdown ended anticlimactically with a bunch of glitchy effects that happened at 9:05 minutes after the countdown turned into _count up_ (or, as normal people would say, _timer_.) Another glitch happened at 1:35:00 or 95 minutes, then another at 9 hours and 05 minutes. The rumours turned insane, and the great reveal was that on 9/5 (see what they did there?), a secret event will take place in Los Angeles. Tickets were distrubuted only amongst premium members of [LP Undeground](https://lpunderground.com/), Linkin Parks's official fan club: every member was entered into a raffle and those who won would be invited to the event (free of charge). There was no other way to get the invitation; tickets were not resellable, and there was no way to buy them.

Well, my wife won the invitation. We got airplane tickets to LA to fly in in the morning and return in the evening. While this was an experience in itself, what followed was a bit of a shock, in a good way. I dropped Helen off at the Universal Studios parking lot, and went to the [theme park](https://www.universalstudioshollywood.com/web/en/us) (I mean, what else do you do in LA when your timeline is unclear and you're waiting for somebody to return from a secret event at an undisclosed location?!).

It was 100+ degrees outside, and my favorite show at the park had a rather large "wet zone" ;) I ended up sitting in the first row and got absolutely drenched. Yay!

After a bunch of rides at my other favorite attraction, the Jurassic Park, it was almost time for the "secret event" to start. By that time, I knew that fans were shuttled by like 40 busses to Warner Studios, which meant (almost certainly!) we'll at least get some new music. The live show on YouTube was showing "The show will begin shortly" message, and at 3 pm on the dot, things started to unfold very quickly. I was perched on a tiny bench, with my phone in hand, in the shade behind the Jurassic Park cafe, amongst thousands of people just enjoying their day at the park.

Well, we've got what we dreamed about. The live show opened with a new Linkin Park song "Emptiness Machine", during which we were introduced to the band's new vocalist [Emily Armstrong](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emily_Armstrong_(musician)>). Admittedly, I was wearing my bone conducting headphones and it was very, very noisy around me, but I got genuine goosebumps when she appeared on stage for the first time: her voice, singing manner, drive - it felt like such a natural and organic fit!

Photos below are from the show, made by Helen.

Naturally, the audience consisted of the most loyal fans of Linkin Park, and they went wild and stayed wild for the whole show, which was a ride to say the least. I'm so extremely happy that Helen got to witness this historic event and be a part of it.

## Notes

Drama around the new vocalist started almost immediately. Apparently, Emily is a member of the Church of Scientology cult. It was also reported that she supported Danny Masterson during his trial for sexual abuse. She's also a woman. And also she's not Chester. Oh, and the new song doesn't sound like Linkin Park. All of this bullshit, you know?

Remember "roudy and loud" chunk of LP fanbase? Some of the same people who were screaming "Linking Park doesn't sound like Linkin Park" after every new album after Meteora was released? The ones who kept upsetting Chester and the rest of the band? Yep, they were the same people. So here's my take on it: not only is Emily not an active scientologist (she was born into the cult, _not_ joined it), she absolutely broke all ties with Masterson as soon as evidence at the trial showed he was a rapist. She is not Chester because nobody is Chester, duh. Yet her style, voice, and vibe is so Linkin Park, I can't even. And just imagine stepping into the role of LP's vocalist, during a LIVE SHOW broadcast in Time Square and everywhere else. Mad respect.

P.S. We've decided to go to at least one domestic show (in Seattle or somewhere on the West Coast) and one international show (in Australia or Japan). The entire tour hasn't been announced yet, but chances are, it will be on sale after Noverber 15th, 2024. Can't wait!
