There's a very good chance that I'm missing some of the shows I've been to, but I wanted to list the ones I do remember. There's no reason for this list to exist, it's just for my own reference. And posterity, of course.

# 2011

## Avril Lavigne

### John Labatt Center, London, ON, Canada

This was the fist show in North America, the first one in Canada, and the first one we've experienced as a family. It was a great show, and I'm glad that we got our last minute tickets (literally, hours before the show).

# 2013

## Hugh Laurie

### Arlene Schnitzer Concert Hall, Portland, OR

Did you know that Hugh Laurie was making music? We went to see him perform with the Copper Bottom Band at Arlene Schnitzer Concert Hall in Portland. It was fun; we had no idea what to expect and artists did not disappoint. While blues is not necessarily my favorite genre, I enjoyed the performance a lot.

# 2015

## Scorpions

### Venue, Kent, WA

Scorpions was the first band I've ever seen play live. I couldn't find a photo of Klaus I've taken outside before their concert in Moscow in 1997, but I did find a video from that concert (this is the only video in the post that was not taken by me):

<YouTube id="n7H35zGQ9JE" className="mx-auto min-w-full rounded-md py-5" />

Anyway, given an opportunity to see Scorpions live, again, I went. It was a 3-hour drive from Vancouver, WA to Kent, but it was worth it.

## Yann Tiersen

### Crystal Ballroom, Portland, OR

I've got no images from this show - in all honesty, there was nothing to _see_, Yann Tiersen should be listened to. We went to the show because we love Amelie and Goodbye Lenin.

# 2016

## Zemfira

### SoDo Showbox, Seattle, WA

I've seen Zemfira live countless times, primarily at festivals. She half-assed this show, was rude to the audience, and overall sucked. This was my first and last time seeing her live.

# 2017

## RHCP

### Moda Center, Portland, OR

We decided to go literally hours before the show started. We bought tickets while we were in line at the door. It was fun! My only complaint is that sound felt a bit off.

## Fall Out Boy

### Key Arena, Seattle, WA

We were supposed to go to two shows at Key Arena in 2017. The first one was Linkin Park touring their "One More Light" album; it got cancelled for obvious reasons. The second one was Fall Out Boy, and it was a great show!

## Bi-2

### Neptune Theatre, Seattle, WA

This one is funny. We drove to Seattle from Vancouver, WA, to see Bi-2 live - it was a gift for my birthday. We stayed at a hotel in Bothell, WA, and had a "meet and greet" with the band. Funny enough, later that year, we moved to Bothell, and I drove past the hotel every day on my way to work.

![Meet and Greet](assets/blog/posts/live-music-in-my-life/IMG_1595.JPG)

The show itself was a blast. Helen was invited as a photographer, and given that Bi-2 is one of her favorive bands ever, she had a great time!

# 2018

## P!nk

### Key Arena, Seattle, WA

Whenever I hear "oh, the show was amazing" I think to myself "But how does it compare to what Pink does at her shows?". Literally, I've never seen anything like this show. I even wonder sometimes if it's fair to call other concerts I've been to "shows". Absolutely incredible, will 100% go again!

## Mumiy Troll

### Neptune Theatre, Seattle, WA

I've seen MT in concert many times, but as with Zemfira, primarily at festivals. This show was the first one Mumiy Troll played in Seattle, and it was glorious. Enjoyed every minute of it.

## Evanesence, Lindsey Stirling

### White River Amphiteatre, Auburn, WA

There's not much to say about this one. We were running late, traffic at the event parking was horrible, and we missed most of Lindsey Stirling's set. When it comes to the Evanesence, the show was a bit of a disappointment for me personally. I'm not the biggest Evanesence fan, and the songs I were there for were some weird acustic versions. Folks around me loved it though, so I'm glad we got to see it.

![Evanesence](assets/blog/posts/live-music-in-my-life/IMG_3922.JPEG)

## Mike Shinoda

### San Francisco, CA

Another memorable experience. It was a rare show that Mike played in our vicinity, so we jumped on a plane to San Francisco. It was my first time seeing bits of Linking Park in person, and although I enjoyed the show, it was really sad that I won't get to see Linking Park in concert, ever. Let's pin this thought for later lol.

## Twenty One Pilots

### Tacoma Dome, Tacoma, WA

One of the shows we went to see just because we could. And I'm really glad we did: the show was great, they performed every song I liked, and to my surprise, I discovered even more songs to explore and enjoy. "Chlorine", for example, now has a permanent place in my Favorites playlist!

# 2019

## One Ok Rock

### SoDo Showbox, Seattle, WA

I was not in the right state of mind to truly enjoy the show, but I can say with confidence that they gave their 100%.

## Rolling Stones

### CenturyLink Field, Seattle, WA

Yet another "because we could" show that we went to. I'm not a fan of the band, but I enjoyed the show. Classical music is fun! :)))

## Bryan Adams

### WAMU, Seattle, WA

Because we could. (it becomes a thieme, doesn't it?)

And then "Summer of '69", "(Everything I Do) I Do It for You", and some other hits that I happily sang-along to. Yay!

## Jade Bird

### Showbox, Seattle, WA

We were not supposed to go to _this_ show. I wasn't supposed to go at all. Yet we ended up going. We didn't know the artist, didn't know any of the opening acts, and basically had no idea what to expect. And we loved it! Jade is such a great singer, pure, raw, honest, and so talented! I couldn't find any pictures or videos of the performance, but just trust me, it was amazing.

## Mumiy Troll

### Showbox, Seattle, WA

Interestingly, this second show we went to was a bit off. Don't get me wrong, it was great, but somehow it felt like a "let's quickly make some money and leave" kind of deal. Still, it was quite a performance!

# 2021

## Weezer, Fall Out Boy, Green Day, Lindsey Stirling

### Lumen Field/WAMU, Seattle, WA

Our first show "after" COVID.

Greenday performed in Seattle right after Chester Bennington's death, and back then I wasn't ready for it. And I've regretted missing it ever since. So as soon as this show was announced, we got our tickets. I'm less familiar with Weezer than with other bands, but I've got a few songs I like and they performed them. I also have to note that it's another example of me dicovering more music I like at live shows!

Fall Out Boy set was phenomenal! The last time I saw them live was at a closed arena, and boy, what a difference open air can make! This show was on a next level, I'm telling you!

Green Day is one of my all-time favorite bands. And I absolutely loved the entire set. I also vowed to never miss their concert again ;)

Finally, a day or two later, there was a show by Lindsey Stirling (the one we partially missed back in 2018, the one with Evanesence, remember?). We went all in this time, with meet and greet, backstage, VIP seating and all. She was incredible, as always!

# 2022

## Imagine Dragons

### Climate Pledge Arena, Seattle, WA

This show was in March 2022. All I remember about that period of time is war. Russia had just invaded Ukraine, and there was nothing else on our minds. We were debating for a while whether to go to the show or not - I mean, we booked it almost a year earlier - and decided that we could always leave it we realize that we can't really enjoy it with everything else going on. While we were sitting in the VIP lounge before the show, we were discussing troop movements, casualties, and the like. A couple nearby started chatting with us all of a sudden, like, "What's your favorite Imagine Dragons song?", "Have you been to their show before?", and so on. It felt strange for a moment, unlit we realized that they were wholeheartedly trying to get our minds off the war, think about something else, get us into more positive mood. We respected and appreciated them for that.

The show was a blast, an absolute blast, I'm telling you!

## Scorpions

### Tacoma Dome, Tacoma, WA

I think this was my last time seeing Scorpions live. When I went to their show in Kent, it was their "final tour". Then they played another show in Seattle. It was also their "last tour". Yet, here we are, they are coming to Tacoma Dome again. I can't pour my heart out every time as if it's the last time. They also get older and older, and I decided that this is how I want to remember them. And in my book, it was their best show ever.

## Paul McCartney

### Tacoma Dome, Tacoma, WA

I mean, who in the world would miss this show? It's basically the Beatles, right? :)) I don't know any songs by Paul McCartney, but maaaan, I enjoyed his performance so much! He's so very down-to-earth, self-aware, and - I'd never though I'd say this - funny. We were seated waaaaaaay far away from the stage so there's no photos or videos of the show.

# 2023

## Boombox

### SoDo, Seattle, WA

Wouldn't miss it for the world. Got my green "Zelensky" t-shirts there, and got to sing along to "Oi u luzi chervona kalyna" with hundreds of Ukrainians around.

## Okean Elzy

### SoDo Showbox, Seattle, WA

Another band I hadn't seen live before. Another fundraiser, and another amazing show! Singing through tears and pain is something no dictator can ever take away.

## Bi-2

### SoDo Showbox, Seattle, WA

I'd say, it was a routine Bi-2 concert. Not in a sense that it was dull or uninspired but in a sense that we always go to see them when they are in the area. It was also the first show since they were officially and legally declared "enemies of the state" by Russia. The show was great, as always. This band just doesn't disappoint.

## Ed Sheeran

### Lumen Field, Seattle, WA

Personally, I went to hear one song. And I did hear it :)) Along with many other songs, some of which I knew and liked. Our local artist Macklemore joined Ed for a surprise performance, which was great. The only downside of this show was that we finally got COVID and spent the next few days pretty sick.

## Tom Odell

### Showbox, Seattle, WA

Helen took me to the show. I didn't know who Tom Odell was, and I didn't particularly enjoy his music. But a live show is a live show, and I enjoyed _that_.

# 2024

## Red Hot Chili Peppers

### Gorge Amphitheatre, WA

First time at the Gorge Amphitheatre, second time seeing RHCP live. They are not getting any younger either :/

### T-Mobile Park, Seattle, WA

Another piece of history, and local history at that! Dave Grohl was a drummer in Nirvana back in the day, and while I'm not a huge Foo Fighters fan, I'll always support local artists looool

## Metallica

### Lumen Field, Seattle, WA

It took a live show for me to admit that I just don't like Metallica. Can't help it. They had a 2-day set, with the songs I liked playing the day before. Still, objectively, it was a great performance by a legendary band, and I'm going to cherish this memory.

## Green Day

### T-Mobile Park, Seattle, WA

Here we go again! This time, the openers were "Linda Linda" and "Rancid", and the show itself was a celebration of the 20th anniversary of the American Idiot and the 30th anniversary of the Dookie. So, naturally, Green Day played both albums in their entirety with a few extra songs thrown in for good measure. 10/10 stars, would go again.

## Jade Bird

### McMenamins, Tacoma, WA

Pretty cool acustic show. [Zan Fiskum](https://www.zanfiskum.com/) opened for Jade Bird, and they even had a song together. I wasn't familiar with Zan's music, and I'm really happy that I discovered her at this Jade Bird's session. Not only is she a great singer-songwriter, but she's also lives practically next door, right here in Everett!

## Mumiy Troll

### Vancouver, BC, Canada

This was the last time we went to see MT live. The show left us with a feeling that the band was at work they didn't really like: they were there to hit specific notes, sing a set of lyrics at a certain volume, drum specific beats, and then get back to their lives. Not an enjoyeble experience.

### Arlington, TX

Finally, this. THIS was not on my 2024 bingo card. Yet here we are, flying out to Texas to see Linkin Park live, Helen - for the second time (the first one being their comeback show earlier this year in LA), and myself for the first time ever. This show was everything I hoped it would be, and then some.
