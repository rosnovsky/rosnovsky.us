I have been neglecting this blog for a while now. Not that I don't have things to post, I really do. I just don't have the energy to do it. And it also feels like I'm not doing anything at all, nothing is new, nothing really matters. I guess, I'm not in the healthiest of headspaces right now, and it's been like that for a while.

Anyway, I'm going to try my best to update this blog more often. Let's see how it goes.

## New job

As mentioned before, I was laid of from Okta in February 2024. It was an even more sobering experience than I expected. Like, I knew that corporations are souleless people squeezing machines, but I haven't experience this side of the sqeeze before. 700 people were laid off, including my entire team, my manager, their manager and a bunch of people on sibling teams; some of the most talented people I've ever worked with were discarded by Okta. It's safe to say that a big part of this layoff was so that Okta could get rid of more Auth0 people - those of us who remember working for a great company, doing shit that matters in a way that actually makes sense. Knowing that, it still stings. Sure, it's not our fault - it's 100% a failure of Okta's senior leadership, and it still stings. It's fair to say that we've got a somewhat satisfactory severence, and guess what? It still stings.

Anyway. I think it will take me a long while to really get over this. The level of corporate distrust and cynicism I've been experiencing is a bit too much even for me. Still, life goes on, and we all have to move on.

These days, I'm working as a Senior Developer at [BeyondID](https://beyondid.com/), a managed identity service provider. My job is to build and integrate [Auth0](https://auth0.com/) into customer's systems. It's been an interesting experience so far, but it's too early to tell how it will turn out long term. I'm not even sure if there is such a thing as "long term" anymore. See my problem now? :(

## New projects

Since February, I've been toying with a bunch of slow-moving projects.

I've released an [Astro Mastodon](https://github.com/rosnovsky/astro-mastodon) package for embedding Mastodon posts into Astro websites.

`@rosnovsky@lounge.town:112623550037161567`

I've built a [Spinup](https://github.com/rosnovsky/spinup) app for quickly setting up new Linux/Mac computers. This one is still in the early stages, but I just had a chance to use it _in real life_ when setting up my new laptop and it's been pretty cool.

I've been working on a new service for myself and my family that stores and makes it easy to search through our most important documents (passports, IDs, taxes, etc). It's been going slowly, but this project got me really excited, and I've been working on it on and off over weekends for a few months now. Not sure I'd ever release it to the public, but who knows.

I've just build my first laptop - a [Framework 16](https://frame.work/products/laptop16-diy-amd-7040). It's the most exciting piece of technology I've seen in years. It replaced my 2019 Dell XPS 15, and I'm _really_ happy with it.

## New games

The latest one that consumed my entirely is Supergiant's [Hades II](https://www.supergiantgames.com/games/hades-ii/). It's just like Hades, but even better.

I've also been playing [Horizon Forbidden West](https://www.guerrilla-games.com/games/) for a while now (well, since it's been released on Steam, that is). Another great sequel, really enjoying it.

[Cassette Beasts](https://www.cassettebeasts.com/), [Dome Keeper](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1637320/Dome_Keeper/), [Factorio](https://www.factorio.com/), [Last of Us Part I](https://store.steampowered.com/agecheck/app/1888930/), [Dredge](https://www.dredge.game/) - there are quite a few games that I've been enjoying lately. Still can't get over how much fun my Steam Deck has been!

Went to the Red Hot Chili Peppers concert at the Gorge a couple of weeks ago. It was pretty good.

We had some awesome time enjoying Aurora Borealis a few weeks back. Really cool, never thought I'd see something like this in person.

It's hikning season, yet I haven't gone on a single hike yet. That's not good. As soon as I post this, I'll go check out my favorite hiking areas around Mountain Loop Highway to see if the trails are free of snow, and if so, I'm hiking next weekend!
