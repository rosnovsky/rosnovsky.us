2021 was a very long year. In part because we didn't get to decompress after 2020, in part because a lot of 2020 stayed with us through the entire 2021, and in part because of a bunch of personal stuff that happened.

As you may or may not know, in my family the New Year is _the holiday_ of the season. When most people are taking down their house decorations, we are just putting them up (to avoid confusion, we mostly decorate inside): the New Year tree, presents, and such. For the past few years we decided against exchanging gifts for the sake of the exchange: there's enough garbage in the world for us to buy some more just because of a calendar date.

In any case, the endo of the year is not only the biggest holiday of the year for me, but also a time to reflect on the year, take stock of my pregress, and make plans for the year ahead.

## COVID remained a factor

## We bought a house

## Work got... interesting
