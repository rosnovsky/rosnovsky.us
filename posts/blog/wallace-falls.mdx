A few years ago, I broke my leg. It happened just a few months before my wife and I were supposed to hike to the rim of Mt. St. Helens (originally known as Loowit by the [Cowlitz ](https://www.cowlitz.org/)and [Klickitat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klickitat_people) people). I haven't hiked ever since. I'd even go as far as to say that I haven't hiked since we moved from Portland area to Seattle.

Anyway, last week I desided that it's time to get back in the game. I plan to do one hike every week, and do an overnight hike somewhere in the North Cascades by the end of summer.

There are different reasons for hiking. Some hike because it's a workout, some tend to go on a hike to hunt for Instagram photos. For some it's a conquest: to claim, to get to the top, to finish a 50-mile loop in a day. For me personally it's an adventure. I walk, through woods, rivers and mountains, I explore this "wilderness", I make some camping food for lunch making it with the river water. I don't care about elevation gain or distance (other than in practical terms: can I make it?); I don't care about the scenary per se, although I like when I can bring back some pictures. I don't care if I finish the trail. I don't care if I overcome something, "survive" or whatever. I only care about the adventure, exploration and lunch.
