I can't remember how this tradition started exactly, but every year since, like, 2015 we've been doing this camping thing right around Father's Day. We camp either at the Ilwaco KOA or at Astoria KOA.

This year's camping was a bit of an oddity: normally, by mid-June, we are deep into summer with the weather being clear, sunny, and somewhere in the 80s throughout the day. This year, it was rainy, overcast, and mid to high 50s. Basically, cold and wet early-spring weather. We even considered not going at all â€” camping in the cold rain is not something people normally enjoy. But hey, that's normally, and normally doesn't apply to us :)

Anyway, below are some pictures from the coast: we ran away from the weather and had spent most of the weekend to the south of Astoria.
