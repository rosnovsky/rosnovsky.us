It was long coming, the day when something happens - and all of a sudden, many people find themselves without a “home” online. Who could’ve guessed even a year ago that an [idiot nazi narcissist man-baby](https://twitter.com/elonmusk) would buy all of Twitter and [immediately start](https://www.theverge.com/2022/10/30/23430008/elon-musk-twitter-homepage-subscriptions-changes) [turning it into](https://www.theverge.com/2022/10/30/23431931/twitter-paid-verification-elon-musk-blue-monthly-subscription) [a shithole of](https://twitter.com/daveyalba/status/1586788146578178049?s=20&t=nUUx_AXtlQH8f1Eqilc_JA) [his dreams](https://www.theverge.com/2022/10/30/23431337/twitter-hateful-tweets-elon-musk-takeover-free-speech)?! Not me, I didn’t see this coming.

Now that all is said and done, I’m really glad that I’ve kept this corner of the web for myself. Mostly, sure, I use it to [meditate](/blog/2021/12/19/meditation-through-code) and fidget with technology. I mean, I’m only human and maintaining a blog is hard work, and I’m lazy. But given current situation around the web, I guess, this is it. Time to be lazy on my own website rather than on someone else’s.

There’s no statement here aside from fuck Elon Musk. Just re-establishing the blog and settling into the new blogging routine.

Oh, and just give me a few days to turn back RSS here! This, actually, is the only thing, I think, may come out of this mess as a net positive: resurgence of RSS. I still miss [Google Reader](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Reader) dearly, but [Feedly](https://feedly.com/) appears to serve me well so far. So I’m going to brush the dust off of my RSS feeds and get this party started!

P.S. I do experiment with alternative social media outlets. The latest one I liked quite a bit is Counter Social, [check it out](https://lounge.town/@rosnovsky).
