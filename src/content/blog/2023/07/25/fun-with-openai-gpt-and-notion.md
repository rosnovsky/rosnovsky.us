Just wanted to share something I’ve been playing with on and off for the past couple of months; a side project I’m pretty happy about.

This project came to be as a way for me to summarize my day’s work and have a handy items to review and/or act upon the next day. Basically, I just wanted to tell the computer what I’ve been doing all day, and let it come up with a list of accomplishments, potential improvements, reading suggestions, etc.

At the time of this writing, TallTale is not ready for prime time. User registration is not set up all the way (it basically just works for me at the moment, and half-works for everybody else), there’s no way to connect your Notion, and there are more things that only work for me so far.

With this being said, I’m embarking on the second stage of the project, making it fully accessible to anybody. At the rate that I’m working on it, it’s going to take at least a couple of months to finish this stage. But hey, it’s something I like toying with and I literally built it for myself, so making it widely available will be fun.

If you want to have something like this right now, you can probably set up a somewhat similar workflow with Pipedream/Zapier. My major goal here was to learn along the way while building something useful to me, and there are probably quicker ways to get something similar working with off-the-shelf tools.
