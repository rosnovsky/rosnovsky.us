So, it's been a while. Just wanted to let those of you interested that I'm alive and well, just a bit bored with the blog and distracted by other shiny things.

## Mastodon

As I mentioned in the past, I'm running a [small instance](https://lounge.town) of Mastodon. It's been fun and educational in more ways than one, to put it mildly. I don't spend too much time running the instance, but I've been full-time, all-in on Mastodon for a while now, and I can't be happier about leaving Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, and Reddit behind for good. Join me at [Lounge Town](https://lounge.town/)!

## Work

Work has been busier than ever. It feels especially good to not only deliver real tangible things that folks use daily, but to also grow as an engineer, also daily. I'm really lucky to be on this team and have free access to this wealth of experience.

## Side projects

These are some of the actual shiny things that I abandoned this blog for :)) I'm poking around different ways I can use LLM/GPT here and there, I low-key build my smart Todoist rescheduling tool, and I've built a thing where I upload a voice note to a cloud drive, and this note magically turns into a useful page in Notion. Stuff is fun!

## Camping

My spouse discovered what we call "black market" for camping sites: people book sites way in advance, can't use their reservations for whatever reason, and they offer these sites on "first come, first serve" basis at cost (+ whatever transfer fee the booking site takes). This way, we've already camped at popular and always fully booked campsites at **Deception Pass** in Washington, **Fort Stevens** on the Oregon Coast, and **Boulder Creek** near Mt. Baker.

Later this month we are going to San Juan Island for a stay on a farm, and I can't wait!

## Books / TV Shows

I'm reading **The Silo** series, recently re-read **The Murderbot Diaries** by [Martha Wells](/library/martha-wells), **Change Agent**, and **The Dune**.

I'm watching **The Crowded Room**, **Hijack**, **The Invasion**, and recently finished **Shrinking**, **Ted Lasso**, **Silo** (the book is so much better... no, not better, just so much more!), **The Last Thing He Told Me**, and **Black Bird**. All of these are on Apple TV+.
