There’s this tradition I’ve been following for over 2 decades now. At the end of every year, I’d make a post with a summary of what happened, how it all went down, and what are my hopes for the year ahead. Let’s get started, shall we?

## Work

Got intense, then weird, then even more weird and more (or less?) intense

## Life

got quiet, too quiet perhaps

## Books

  - Red Team Blues
  - Silo (the whole thing)
  - Dune (finally)
  - System Collapse
  - Lost in Time
  

## Games
