There’s this tradition I’ve been following for over 2 decades now. At the end of every year, I’d make a post with a summary of what happened, how it all went down, and what are my hopes for the year ahead. Let’s get started, shall we?

## Work

Got intense, then weird, then even more weird and more intense but more focused. This is a fairly general summary of my year at work. I worked a lot with unfamiliar tech (primarily, `Kubernetes`), and learned a lot as a result. For example, I've [moved this website](/blog/vercel-to-kubernetes) and a few other projects to my own `k8s` cluster. There were a lot of changes, a lot of motion, and it's yet to be seen how all this stuff will affect my corner of Okta. Personally, I feel like I've grown a lot as an engineer, but we'll see if I actually did when annual performance evaluation happens early next year.

## Life

Life got quiet, even quieter than before. We camped quite a bit this year, went to San Juan island for the second year in a row; we love it there. I didn't hike, like, at all. I rarely leave the house in general. 

Went to a few concerts, including Ed Sheeran's one, from which we returned with our first COVID infection. The COVID part wasn't fun; the concert was great!

Our child graduated from high school, got their driver's license, and now works a retail job. It's really cool to see this grown up begining _to adult_.
