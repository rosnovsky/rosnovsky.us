Some of you here are old enough to remember the days when _yours truly_ was an avid blogger and even a podcaster. Let's admit it, for the longest time most of you here knew me thanks to [Rosnovsky Park&trade; Weekly](https://rosnovsky.gumroad.com/l/gdTD), [Rosnovsky in Canada](https://rosnovsky.gumroad.com/l/iYQx), or the [Evergreen Podcast](https://rosnovsky.gumroad.com/l/qaxYX). While these are still [available here](https://rosnovsky.gumroad.com/), I'm not doing any of this anymore.

Initially, I paused podcasting when Covid hit. I was overwhelmed, concerned about the future, and was just plain tired. After all, my first episode was released in April 2006; since then I've immigrated twice, moved apartments and homes exactly 11 times, changed 6 cars, lived in 4 different cities, 3 countries, and 2 continents. I know, it doesn't sound like much, but it's emotionally exhausting. And with the podcast not replenishing my energy anymore, I decided to take a break. And as with many other things, it's easier to stop than to start again. So I never did start again.

Every year I tell myself that I should at least start blogging again. And every year I fail miserably. So I'm not going to try again. I'm just going to post what's on my mind, and who knows, maybe it will turn into something regular, eventually.

## Music of the Week

So, there are two things I want to share. The first one is a song that I've been vibing to: Keasbey Nights (1998) by Catch 22 (these days it's performed by [Streetlight Manifesto](https://www.streetlightmanifesto.com/), a band founded by a former member of Catch 22).

The second thing is more of a "happening" than "here, a song I like". Hel and I went to the Rise of the Roach show here in Seattle. [Underauth](https://underoath777.com/) and [Rise Against](https://riseagainst.com/) were amazing opening acts, and Papa Roach... Well, it's Papa Roach.

And then there was "In The End". Jacoby Shaddix and Chester Bennington were good friends since the early 2000s, and when Chester passed away from suicide in 2017, it hit Jacoby hard.

Now Papa Roach has an entire section of their shows dedicated to suicide prevention and awareness. Oh, and there's a song to go along with it, "**Leave A Light On (Talk Away The Dark)**".

I must add that the show itself was WILD. The crowd was incredible (I haven't seen this many anti-nazi t-shirts, buttons, bracelets, etc anywhere outside of an actual protest), sound was great, and the energy that the band was pouring onto the crowd was unmatched.

Thank you, Papa Roach!

Finally, as a bonus, I'd stopped by at "[Silver Platters](https://www.silverplatters.com/)" today to grab some CDs (I've rebuilt most of my music collection on my [Plex server](https://plex.tv/), and I no longer rely on streaming services). The LP poster was a nice touch.

Well, Rebecca, here's my take: Scrubs is a show that can be the show of the week every week. That's <strike>how good it is</strike> how much I love it. There are some episodes that didn't age _too_ well (one episode was even pulled from the streaming services in 2020 - the cast insisted on pulling it), there are things that are considered cringe and inappropiate at times, but it's a wonderful story about young folks, their friendships, struggles, and growth. I highly recommend this show, all _8 seasons_ (I said what I said).

  <div>
    <p>In a very different but almost identical way that Scrubs can be the show of the week every week, the Murderbot Diaries can be the book of the week every week. [Martha Wells](https://marthawells.dreamwidth.org/) published "[_All Systems Red_](https://bookshop.org/p/books/all-systems-red-martha-wells/7104100?ean=9780765397539&next=t/)" in 2017, and the latest follow-up in the series - "[_System Collapse_](https://bookshop.org/p/books/system-collapse-martha-wells/19538545?ean=9781250826978&next=t)" - came out in late 2023. She is awesome, the books are great (even when they are too short), and... _I hate planets_ too!</p>
    <p>Oh, oh, almost forgot! It's also going to be an [Apple TV+ series soon](https://tv.apple.com/us/show/murderbot/umc.cmc.5owrzntj9v1gpg31wshflud03)! I don't know if the show will be as good as the books, but the cast alone makes me thrilled for May 16, 2025!</p>

And for those familiar with the book series, here's a wonderfully touching [animatic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDMSHgQY5rM):

## Drums of the Week

Now, here's a person 4x younger than me does fantastic job covering this song. There are some questionable moments, but hey, they are, like, ten, give me a break!

## Dopamine of the Week

This one is personal. Somebody reminded me of this hike the other day, and I can't wait to go back there. I've hiked this trail a few times, and the last hike there last year was the most relaxing day of all of 2024 for me. I ended up reading a book (one of the [Old Man's War series](https://bookshop.org/p/books/old-man-s-war-series-old-man-s-war-the-ghost-brigades-the-last-colony-zoe-s-tale-the-human-division-the-end-of-all-things-john-scalzi/7c497534c41eab9b?ean=9780765396761&next=t) by [John Scalzi](https://whatever.scalzi.com/)) in the meadow, which I think used to be a town square :)

Oh, there's more. Linkin Park just released a new song "Up From The Bottom" (coming out on their delux edition of "_From Zero_" in mid-May 2025).

And finally, a real place _full_ of pure dopomine: ["Wit's End" bookstore in Stanwood, WA](https://www.witsendbookstore.com/). Be sure to stop by when you're in the area!
