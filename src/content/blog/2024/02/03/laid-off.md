It's been a wild ride. I [joined Auth0](/blog/new-job-auth0) in December 2019 as a [Developer Support Engineer](/blog/developer-support-observations). A year later, I moved to a newly created Customer Onboarding team; we were tasked with helping new enterprise customers onboard faster and take full advantage of everything that Auth0 had to offer. After some soul searching, the team became the "Digital Experience" team: our role shifted from facilitating customer onboarding to building out the entire customer journey from day one to (hopefully) renewal. It involved building tools, figuring out what features would help, how to build and integrate them with Auth0 product, and more. Throughout this time, I was working as a Software Engineer; in September 2023, I moved to the Tooling team (I've been on this team _unofficially_ for over a year at that point.) 

On February 1, 2024, almost the entire team was laid off. Multiple sibling teams were also laid off. My manager, my manager's manager, all gone. Everyone I've ever worked closely with, with exception of literally 2 people, were all laid off.
