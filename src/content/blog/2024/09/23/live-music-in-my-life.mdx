description: Since I've moved out of Russia in 2011, I've been to dozens of concerts. Just wanted to have a record of the shows I liked, mostly for my own reference.

There's a very good chance that I'm missing some of the shows I've been to, but I wanted to list the ones I do remember. There's no reason for this list to exist, it's just for my own reference. And posterity, of course.

## 2011

### Avril Lavigne

#### John Labatt Center, London, ON, Canada

This was the fist show in North America, the first one in Canada, and the first one we've experienced as a family. It was a great show, and I'm glad that we got our last minute tickets (literally, hours before the show).
