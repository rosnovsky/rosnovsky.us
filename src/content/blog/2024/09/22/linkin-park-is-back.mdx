Linkin Park has been a part of my life for well over 20 years now. I remember hanging out with friends at their dorm in Moscow, turning volume up whenever _In the End_ or _Numb_ was playing on ULTRA; I remember posting on LiveJournal and setting "Current Music" to Mike Shinoda's Fort Minor _Where'd You Go_. Unlike my spouse, though, I wasn't a hardcode fan of LP, yet with her influence, I've been listening to them a lot more for years.

In 2017, LP released a new album _One More Light_ and announced a world tour. There was no way we'd miss it: neither my wife nor I have ever seen LP live. So we've got our tickets sometime in spring and were waiting for the show with great anticipation and excitement.

But some things are just not meant to be. On July 20, 2017, LP's lead singer [Chester Bennington](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chester_Bennington) tragically died of suicide. Throughout his life, Chester struggled depression, addiction, and mental health issues stemming from being abused as a child, and he was hit hard by the tragic death of his good friend [Chris Cornell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Cornell) of Soundgarden. Another contributing factor was the fact that a roudy and loud chunk of LP fanbase was really nasty about the new album, which Chester reportedly took to heart.

On July 29, 2017, my wife and I organized a memorial in Centennial Park in Seattle. A few dozen people showed up, and we were all very emotional.

I've made a video of the event, and it's available on YouTube:
