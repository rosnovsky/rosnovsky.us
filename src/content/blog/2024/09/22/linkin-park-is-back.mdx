Linkin Park has been a part of my life for well over 20 years now. I remember hanging out with friends at their dorm in Moscow, turning volume up whenever _In the End_ or _Numb_ was playing on ULTRA; I remember posting on LiveJournal and setting "Current Music" to Mike Shinoda's Fort Minor _Where'd You Go_. Unlike my spouse, though, I wasn't a hardcode fan of LP, yet with her influence, I've been listening to them a lot more for years.

In 2017, LP released a new album _One More Light_ and announced a world tour. There was no way we'd miss it: neither my wife nor I have ever seen LP live. So we've got our tickets sometime in spring and were waiting for the show with great anticipation and excitement.

But some things are just not meant to be. On July 20, 2017, LP's lead singer [Chester Bennington](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chester_Bennington) tragically died of suicide. Throughout his life, Chester struggled depression, addiction, and mental health issues stemming from being abused as a child, and he was hit hard by the tragic death of his good friend [Chris Cornell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Cornell) of Soundgarden. Another contributing factor was the fact that a roudy and loud chunk of LP fanbase was really nasty about the new album, which Chester reportedly took to heart.

On July 29, 2017, my wife and I organized a memorial in Centennial Park in Seattle. A few dozen people showed up, and we were all very emotional.

I've made a video of the event, and it's available on YouTube:

Later in 2017, a huge memorial concert was held in Los Angeles, with many Chester and LP friends singing Linking Park songs ‚Äî from _Blink-182_, Korn, and _System of a Down_ to _Machine Gun Kelly_, _One Ok Rock_, and _Alanis Morissette_. We had a chance to go but chickened out. We've regretted it ever since.

In 2018, we went to San Francisco for Mike Shinoda solo show, mostly to get some sort of closure. At the time, I thought that that's as close to LP concert that I'd ever get.

I've been following the band all these years even though it was uncler if there was a band to follow... until late August 2024.

## Linkin Park is back!

At the end of August 2024, a strange countown from 100 hours appeared on Linkin Park website. The countdown ended anticlimactically with a bunch of glitchy effects that happened at 9:05 minutes after the countdown turned into _count up_ (or, as normal people would say, _timer_.) Another glitch happened at 1:35:00 or 95 minutes. The rumours turned insane, and the great reveal was that on 9/5 (see what they did there?), a secret event will take place in Los Angeles. Tickets were distrubuted only amongst premium members of LP Undeground, Linkin Parks's official fan club: every member was entered into a raffle and those who won would be invited to the event (free of charge). There was no other way to get the invitation; tickets were not resellable, and there was no way to buy them.

Well, my wife got the invitation. We got airplane tickets to LA to fly in in the morning and return in the evening.
