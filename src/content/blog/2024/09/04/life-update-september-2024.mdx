title: Life Update September 2024
description: The summer is almost over, time to reflect on how it all went. I hiked a bit, worked a lot, read even more, went to a couple of concerts, traveled a bit. All in all, it wasn't a bad summer.

The cover image for this post is a phote I took in one of my favorite places around here: [Camano Island State Park](https://parks.wa.gov/find-parks/state-parks/camano-island-state-park). I drive here weekly (or at least I try), sometimes twice a week. It's a beautiful beach park. It's somewhat remote, not very crowded, reasonably near my house (about a 30-minute drive away). I come to relax, eat, and read.

An e-reader is visible in the foreground, displaying text from a book. The background shows a calm water expanse with distant shores, suggesting a peaceful reading spot in nature.](assets/blog/posts/life-update-september-2024/IMG_4291.JPEG)

Did I meantion that I come here often? I did? Well, ok. I do come here often.

The lighting suggests it's early evening, creating a serene shoreside reading setting.](assets/blog/posts/life-update-september-2024/IMG_4354.JPEG)

What do you mean "I get it, you come here often"? How did you even know?.. Oh. Oh, I see. In any case, I do like it here. I really do! :)

## Hiking

One of the "goals" I've set for myself this year was to get out hiking again. I wanted to do at least two overnight hikes this summer, but fell short. I've only done one day hike at Monte Cristo in Henry M. Jackson Wilderness near Glacier Peak. I've [been here before](/blog/monte-cristo-ghost-town-trail), [twice](/blog/hiking-season-failed-kickoff), and I know this trail well: it's an easy one, with enough scenery to keep you entertained. At the end of the trail, I laid down in the grass in the middle of an abandoned town of Monte Cristo and read a book for a bit. Really nice way to spend a day.

![Two weathered signs leaning against a large rock formation in a forested area. The signs read "Welcome to Monte Cristo" and "Monte Cristo" in faded lettering. The surrounding vegetation and moss-covered rocks suggest a remote, abandoned location with historical significance.](assets/blog/posts/life-update-september-2024/IMG_4300.JPEG)
![A mountain landscape with a swift river in the foreground. The river flows through a forested area with vibrant green vegetation. In the background, snow-capped mountain peaks are visible, creating a dramatic contrast with the lush forest. The scene captures the diverse ecosystems of the Cascade Range.](assets/blog/posts/life-update-september-2024/IMG_4301.JPEG)
![A scenic forest view with a rushing stream in the foreground. Tall evergreen trees surround the stream, creating a lush green canopy. Sunlight filters through the trees, illuminating the fast-flowing water cascading over rocks and boulders. The image captures the beauty and serenity of a wilderness landscape.](assets/blog/posts/life-update-september-2024/IMG_4302.JPEG)

The second hike was supposed to be an overnight one: I'd arrive at the trailhead late in the evening, hike to the campsite the next day, and come back in the morning on day three. This's another one of those "[I've been here before](/blog/white-pass-hike)" hikes, but it didn't go as planned. I did arrive at the trailhead on Friday afternoon; there were dozens of cars parked around the entrance, and the spot I used to pitch my tent was covered with fallen old growth trees. I did find a spot between the branches, trunks, and the rest of the mayhem, but as I was pitching my tent, I realized that I forgot to pack two very importnatn things: a headlamp and some bug repellent. While not having a headlamp wasn't too bit of a problem, not having bug repellent was. Like, it was bad. I've pitched my tent in under 10 minutes, and by the time I got inside, I was basically one huge mosquito bite. It was quite miserable and sealed the whole hike. I enjoyed sleeping in the tent, but it the morning, I packed up and left.

Sunlight filters through the trees, creating a dappled effect on the ground and tent. Camping gear is visible inside the partially open tent.](assets/blog/posts/life-update-september-2024/IMG_4346.JPEG)

Towering evergreen trees line the road and dot the landscape. In the background, snow-capped mountain peaks rise dramatically against a vivid blue sky, creating a stunning backdrop to this quaint rural scene.](assets/blog/posts/life-update-september-2024/IMG_4350.JPEG)

Oh well. Some things just don't work out. It's ok. I'll try again next year.

## Beach

One of the highlights of the summer was a trip to Long Beach, Washington. My spouse found a really nice house near the coast, and we spent a weekend on the beach. And when at the beach, what do you do? That's correct, you read! I mean, _I read_; you do you, of course :))

In the background, the beach stretches out to meet the Pacific Ocean, with blurry shapes of people and cars in the distance.

## Around Puget Sound

We had our friends from Oregon over for the Labor Day weekend, and it was quite a bit of fun! We went on a ferry ride to Kingston, drove to Poulsbo for lunch at an amazing local restaurant (try grilled salmon!), and took a different ferry back so that we'd sail back with a view of Seattle skyline. I enjoyed every moment of this day!

![View from a ferry leaving a dock. The image shows the ferry's bow, loading ramp, and part of the deck. Ahead is a ferry terminal with a raised roadway leading to it. In the background, a coastal town is visible with trees and buildings. The sky is clear blue, suggesting good weather.](assets/blog/posts/life-update-september-2024/IMG_4457.JPEG)

![A panoramic view of a waterfront city skyline, likely Seattle. The image shows tall buildings, including the distinctive Space Needle. In the foreground is a wide street with parked cars and trees. On the waterfront, there's a large building with a fish illustration, probably a seafood restaurant. A cruise ship is visible on the right. The scene depicts a bustling urban waterfront on a clear day.](assets/blog/posts/life-update-september-2024/IMG_4501.JPEG)

Oh, and of course, I've visited Poulsbo's indie bookstore and expressed my love and support for local independent bookstores the only way I know how: by buying stuff from them. Got myself a mystery book, a bunch of stickers, and a couple   pins. You guys, support you local bookstores if you can! And when in Poulsbo, make sure to check out [Away With Words](https://awaywithwordsbookshop.com/), it's a really, _really_ nice store!

![A collection of book-related items on a wooden surface. There's a novel titled "Her Hidden Genius", a brown paper bag labeled "Historical Fiction" and "Female", and various bookstore merchandise including stickers and cards with reading-related slogans. The items suggest a purchase from an independent bookstore with a focus on promoting reading.](assets/blog/posts/life-update-september-2024/IMG_4479.JPEG)



## Work

- what I actually do
- what bugs me

## Concerts

### Skate for Ukraine show
![An indoor ice skating performance. A group of figure skaters in colorful costumes stand on the ice rink, facing the audience. Behind them is a large banner in blue and yellow (colors of the Ukrainian flag) with the message "THANK YOU FOR YOUR SUPPORT". The scene suggests a show of solidarity with Ukraine. The venue appears to be a professional ice rink with stadium-style seating visible in the background.](assets/blog/posts/life-update-september-2024/IMG_4399.JPEG)

Went to a really cool ice skating event "Skate for Ukraine: The Forest Song", featuring not only some of the students of a local ice skating school run by our friends but also independent Ukraine's first _ever_ Olympic gold medalist [Oksana Baiul-Farina](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oksana_Baiul) who turned out to be an absolute treasure of a human being. I'm not sure how much money was raised overall, but it's in the tens of thousands of dollars. If you want to [chip in](https://www.volia.fund/), I'd really appreciate it!

### Foo Fighters
![An expansive nighttime view of a large-scale outdoor concert. The image shows a massive stage setup with multiple large screens displaying close-ups of performers. Bright lights and smoke effects create a dramatic atmosphere. The Foo Fighters logo is prominently displayed above the stage. A dense crowd fills the foreground, stretching back as far as the eye can see. The scene is at the Seattle Mariners' home field the T-Mobile Park, with city lights visible in the background.](assets/blog/posts/life-update-september-2024/IMG_4430.JPEG)

Thinking "we need to support our local bands", my spouse and I went to the [Foo Fighters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foo_Fighters) concert. It was a really cool show, and I'm glad we went. I'm not a huge fan of their music, but I am a huge fan of live music in general and Dave Grohl personally. The show was supposed to start at 8 pm after all the opening acts, and I still can't get over the fact that FF were on stage at 8:00 pm on the dot. I'm old enough to say this with a lot of confidence: it's extremely rare for a band to begin on time; I've _never_ seen this happen before. Mad respect. Also, they did play my favorites, "Monkey Wrench" and "Everlong", so I'm really happy with the show :)

### Metallica
![A close-up of a large, illuminated display screen at the Metallica concert in Lumen Field. The screen shows vibrant artwork featuring the Metallica logo, a fierce-looking wolf, and skulls, all in shades of blue, white, and red. The image is taken from below, showing part of the stadium's structural framework above. The dramatic lighting and artwork create a powerful visual impact, fitting for a metal concert.](assets/blog/posts/life-update-september-2024/IMG_4507.JPEG)

Did I mention that I love live music? Well, sometimes it gets weird. I don't listen to Metallica aside from literally two songs: "Nothing Else Matters" and "The Unforgiven" (both parts). But when an opportunity to see a truly legendary band in concert comes up, I'm always ready to jump on the bandwagon.

![A striking view of a large stadium concert - it's day two of Metallica at Lumen Field. The image shows massive yellow cylindrical structures suspended above the crowd, each decorated with a stylized cityscape design. These are part of an elaborate stage setup, illuminated against the darkening sky. The stadium's roof is visible in the background, and a dense crowd can be seen below, creating an atmosphere of excitement and spectacle.](assets/blog/posts/life-update-september-2024/IMG_4506.JPEG)

It's almost funny how it took me going to the concert to realize that I _do not_ like Metallica, I just like two of their songs. It doesn't mean that the show wasn't great or that they did a poor job: the show was excellent, with a lot of energy, visuals, and great atmosphere! If 15-year-old me was told that one day he'd be standing just a few dozen yards away from James Hetfield and sing along to "The Unforgiven", he'd never believe it. Yet here we are.

![An atmospheric shot of the Metallica concert at Lumen Field, capturing the scale and energy of the event. Large cylindrical screens hang from the ceiling, displaying close-ups of the band performing. Bright stage lights and smoke effects fill the air, creating a dramatic ambiance. In the foreground, a guitarist (James Hetfield) is visible on stage, illuminated by golden light. The image conveys the immersive and high-energy experience of the live performance.](assets/blog/posts/life-update-september-2024/IMG_4511.JPEG)

## Movies

Not much to report here. I've finally watched [Nimona](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt19500164/), and absolutely loved it. So much so that I read my teenager's copy of the [original graphic novel](https://bookshop.org/p/books/nimona-noelle-stevenson/6432916?ean=9780062278227) (which is a bit different but as good as the movie).

Since this is a Deadpool household, we went to see [Deadpool and Wolverine](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6263850/) almost as soon as it came out. It was excellent (if you're into this kind of thing, at least), but not as good as the first two in my entirely clueless opinion. Don't get me wrong, it's a very fun movie, but I felt like it lacked some of the Mr. Pool's magic of the first two. Perhaps, I just need to watch it again when it's released on streaming.

Finally, I did a thing that I wanted to do for, like, a decade: I watched all of the Marvel Cinematic Universe movies in its timeline order: from the first Iron Man all the way to the latest Marvels. Loved it a lot, 5 stars, no notes.

## Games

As far as games go, I've finally gotten around to playing through [Firewatch](https://www.firewatchgame.com/), a nice and chill game by Panic, and [Life is Strange: True Colors](https://lifeisstrange.square-enix-games.com/en-us/games/life-is-strange-true-colors). The latter was a bit short for my taste (or at least it felt noticeably shorter than the original _Life is Strange_ and _Life is Strange: Before the Storm_.) Still, it was a lot of fun. Oh, and I've been playing [Hades II](https://www.supergiantgames.com/games/hades-ii/) which is in early access on Steam now. It's entirely possible that the sequel will be even better that the first installment, let me tell you that!

## Hope & Joy

![Political figures on stage celebrating victory - Vice President Kamala Harris, Second Gentelmen Doug Emhoff, Governor Tim Walz and his wife Gwen Walz. US flags in background. DNC 2024 logo visible, and the group's joyful expressions suggest a moment of victory or triumph.](assets/blog/posts/life-update-september-2024/IMG_0419.PNG)

This blog officially and enthusiastically endorses [Kamala Harris for president](https://kamalaharris.com/).

![Musical performance on stage by Pink featuring her daughter Willow. The stage has a dramatic blue backdrop with white stars. An American flag is visible to the right. The performers represent a diverse group, and their positioning suggests a choreographed ensemble piece. ](assets/blog/posts/life-update-september-2024/IMG_0415.PNG)
