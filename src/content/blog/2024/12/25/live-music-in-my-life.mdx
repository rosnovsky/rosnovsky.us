description: Since I've moved out of Russia in 2011, I've been to dozens of concerts. Just wanted to have a record of the shows I liked, mostly for my own reference.

There's a very good chance that I'm missing some of the shows I've been to, but I wanted to list the ones I do remember. There's no reason for this list to exist, it's just for my own reference. And posterity, of course.

# 2011

## Avril Lavigne

### John Labatt Center, London, ON, Canada

This was the fist show in North America, the first one in Canada, and the first one we've experienced as a family. It was a great show, and I'm glad that we got our last minute tickets (literally, hours before the show).

# 2013

## Hugh Laurie
### Arlene Schnitzer Concert Hall, Portland, OR

Did you know that Hugh Laurie was making music? We went to see him perform with the Copper Bottom Band at Arlene Schnitzer Concert Hall in Portland. It was fun; we had no idea what to expect and artists did not disappoint. While blues is not necessarily my favorite genre, I enjoyed the performance a lot.

# 2015

## Scorpions
### Venue, Kent, WA

Scorpions was the first band I've ever seen play live. I couldn't find photo of Klaus I'd made in 1997 before their concert in Moscow, but I did find a video from that concert:

Anyway, given an opportunity to see Scorpions live, again, I went. It was a 3-hour drive from Vancouver, WA to Kent, but it was worth it.

## Yann Tiersen
### Crystal Ballroom, Portland, OR

I've got no images from this show - in all honesty, there was nothing to _see_, Yann Tiersen should be listened to. We went to the show because we love Amelie and Goodbye Lenin.

# 2016

## Zemfira
### SoDo Showbox, Seattle, WA

I've seen Zemfira live countless times, primarily at festivals. She half-assed this show, was rude to the audience, and overall sucked. This was my first and last time seeing her live.

# 2017

## RHCP
### Moda Center, Portland, OR

We decided to go literally hours before the show started. We bought tickets while we were in line at the door. It was fun! My only complaint is that sound felt a bit off.

## Fall Out Boy
### Key Arena, Seattle, WA

We were supposed to go to two shows at Key Arena in 2017. The first one was Linkin Park touring their "One More Light" album; it got cancelled for obvious reasons. The second one was Fall Out Boy, and it was a great show!

## Bi-2
### Neptune Theatre, Seattle, WA

This one is funny. We drove to Seattle from Vancouver, WA, to see Bi-2 live - it was a gift for my birthday. We stayed at a hotel in Bothell, WA, and had a "meet and greet" with the band. Funny enough, later that year, we moved to Bothell, and I drove past the hotel every day on my way to work.

The show itself was a blast. Helen was invited as a photographer, and given that Bi-2 is one of her favorive bands ever, she had a great time!

# 2018

## P!nk
### Key Arena, Seattle, WA

Whenever I hear "oh, the show was amazing" I think to myself "But how does it compare to what Pink does at her shows?". Literally, I've never seen anything like this show. I even wonder sometimes if it's fair to call other concerts I've been to "shows". Absolutely incredible, will 100% go again!

## Mumiy Troll
### Neptune Theatre, Seattle, WA

I've seen MT in concert many times, but as with Zemfira, primarily at festivals. This show was the first one Mumiy Troll played in Seattle, and it was glorious. Enjoyed every minute of it.
