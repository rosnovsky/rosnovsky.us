description: Another year is in the books, it's time for the latest installment of my "Year in Review" series. This year sucked in so many ways, but there were a few bright spots as well.

Another terrible year is coming to an end, and it's a tradition I have here to write up a year in review. I've been doing this in one form or another since 2003, and I'll keep doing it for as long as I can. Let's begin.

## Laid off

The year started off with yours truly being laid off. [Okta](https://www.okta.com) discarded me and dozens of my colleagues just like that. My entire team, a few of my "sibling" teams, my manager, their manager, all got laid off. It is pretty clear to me that Okta was cleaning house from [Auth0](https://auth0.com) leftovers - people who can't/won't think like corporate drones. Oh, well. I never liked Okta, their culture being at odds with Auth0's culture, their botched acquisition of Auth0 (and how they tried to cover up their failure), and many other things. It was sad to lose a job and to lose my team. 

## New job

The day of the layoffs, a recruiter from [BeyondID](https://beyondid.com) reached out to me and offered me a job: a Senior Developer position working exclusively with Auth0 stack and helping their customers develop and deploy CIAM in various shapes and forms. I agreed, and in April started my new job there. The difficulty for me is that it's a Professional Services kind of role, and I prefer product-focused work. I'm still unsure how it's going to work out in the long run, but it's been going all right so far.

## Few hikes, some travel

I wanted to hike much more this year, but alas. My only overnight trip to the [Glacier Peak](https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/hikes/glacier-peak) area was a disaster of my own making, and I had to cut the trip short. Another hike to the ghost town of [Monte Cristo](https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/hikes/monte-cristo-ghost-town) was a success, but it kind of wraps up my hiking for the year. I'll do better next year.

We went to the Coast this year with my wife, my child, and their partner. It was a calm, relaxing trip, and we had a lot of fun.

## Linkin Park is back

In September 2024, [Linkin Park](https://www.linkinpark.com) reunited, and we [flew to LA](/blog/linkin-park-is-back) for their comeback show.

It is probably the most memorable event of the year for me. Not the LA show, but just the fact that LP is back.

In November, we went to see them live in Texas, which was an entire experience in itself: flying to Dallas in the early morning, arriving in the afternoon, settling into our Airbnb, the show itself, and a visit to the [Dealey Plaza](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dealey_Plaza) the next day. All in all, it was a lot, and I mean a lot of fun.

Since the release of their new album "From Zero", they also announced a world tour next year. And we are going to all three of their PNW shows in September 2025: in Portland, Seattle, and Vancouver, BC. It's nice to have something to look forward to in 2025.

## Games

Ever since I've got myself a [Steam Deck](https://www.steamdeck.com), I've been playing a lot of video games.

Lately, I've been really enjoying the game [Stardew Valley](https://www.stardewvalley.net).

I guess games and music are how I escape from reality. Not a healthy coping mechanism, but it will have to do, at least for now.

## Projects

I've built quite a few things this year, most of those things I've built for work. Still, I've got a hobby project I love: a website that displays the music I'm listening to.

No major open source contributions this year; I was just trying to keep my head above water. Still, here's one OSS thing I've built this year.

## Music

Aside from the obvious (obvious being "From Zero" by Linkin Park), this year I've discovered [The Linda Lindas](https://thelindalindas.com), [Rancid](https://rancidrancid.com), [Bad Omens](https://badomensofficial.com), [A Day to Remember](https://adtr.com), [Yellowcard](https://yellowcardrock.com), [Sleep Token](https://sleep-token.com), [Rise Against](https://www.riseagainst.com), and some other bands.

This year, I've completely transitioned off of Apple Music: all my music is now in my Plex library, ripped from CDs I've bought. We also got a good vinyl record player and have been enjoying it a lot.

I also love the fact that [The Offspring](https://offspring.com), [blink-182](https://www.blink182.com), [The All-American Rejects](https://www.allamericanrejects.com), and some other legendary bands released new albums this year.

## Books/Movies/TV Shows

Didn't read much this year, and mostly re-watched old TV shows and movies. Want to note the ["Arcane"](https://www.netflix.com/title/81435684) series (it's awesome!), and the ["Deadpool & Wolverine"](https://www.marvel.com/movies/deadpool-and-wolverine) movie.

## Looking forward

There's no chance that 2025 will be a better year than 2024, which sucked in many different ways. Still, I'm looking forward to the live shows, family reuniting here in Washington, and otherwise not dying, I guess.

I hope to take better care of my mental and physical health next year, hike some more, spend time on San Juan Island, and write more.

Anyway, thanks for following along, and see you next year!
