In the foreground, a white takeout container sits on the weathered planks, topped with a black e-reader with a white-on-red EFF \"Fight Dystopia\" sticker. Beyond, the calm waters of the Saratoga Passage stretch to the horizon, where distant shores of Whidbey Island are visible. A lone sailboat can be seen in the middle distance. The late afternoon sun casts a warm glow on the scene, with light sparkling on the water's surface." }

The cover image for this post is a phote I took in one of my favorite places around here: Camano Island State Park. I drive here weekly (or at least I try), sometimes twice a week.
