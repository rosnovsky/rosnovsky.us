2020 is a special year in so many ways, mostly pretty terrible and sad ways to be honest. However, there are some silver linings there, and one of them I mentioned earlier in a [post about staying entertained during Covid-19](/blog/entertainment-in-times-of-covid-19/): tech conferences moving online. Not only that but as a result of increased accessibility, we are getting exposed to a wide and fantastic variety of speakers from across the globe. Every conference now can have any speaker at any time!

[**Byteconf**](https://www.bytesized.xyz/conference) is an online native. Run by [**Bytesized**](https://www.bytesized.xyz/), they've been doing online-only conferences for years now. These conferences are free to watch and participate, and usually bring together a pretty awesome lineup of speakers. This year's **Byteconf React 2020** was no exception.

One of the most impressive things I want to mention is production quality. The whole stream looked super slick, intermissions and music were spot-on, and talks just flowed. Pretty cool, and a great example for others to follow â€” yes, I'm looking at you [Svelte Society Day 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rnG-OlzGSs)! ðŸ™„

> I love that I can fall behind on live stream of the conference, pause it, rewind and catch up as soon as I my days gets a bit open. Or I can just skip to whatever is happening live at the moment, and catch up with talks I missed sometime later. Try this with a live, in-person event. Go on, I DARE YOU! :)

## Speeding up your Gatsby app in a day â€” [Henrique Cavalieri](https://henrique.codes/)

Pretty cool tutorial-like talk by [Henrique Cavalieri](https://henrique.codes/). Quite a few tricks I didn't realize I could apply at all! And mind you, it only took me a few minutes get here:

To be fair, my site was in the low 90s anyway ;)

## Static Sites and Serverless Functions - A Dynamic Combination â€” [James Quick](https://www.jamesqquick.com/)

<YouTube youTubeId="hiAK3Yrn93k" />

My Auth0 colleague [James Quick](https://www.jamesqquick.com/) presented a pretty cool case of using Trello as a content database for a static website with serverless functions driving it all in the _backend_ (what does _backend_ and _frontend_ even mean anymore, anyway?!). I'm going to use this talk as a starting point when I decide to add comments to my theme here.

## A Gentle Introduction to Building Serverless Apps â€” [Joe Karlsson](https://www.joekarlsson.com/)

<YouTube youTubeId="eS-6llSUW7Y" />

Pretty awesome and beginner-friendly introduction to serverless apps by [Joe Karlsson](https://www.joekarlsson.com/). If you never really got on the servreless train, it's a great primer and a chance to catch up!

## Creating a Component Library â€” [Kathryn Grayson Nanz](https://twitter.com/kathryngrayson)

<YouTube youTubeId="POKpw2TInSc" />

This is something I'm yet to implement: Storybook fascinates me, but for some reason, it always seems tedious to use in 1-3 person projects. Anyway, this is a great intro to component libraries from [Kathryn Grayson Nanz](https://twitter.com/kathryngrayson).

## Power Up Gatsby with Auth! â€” [Sam Julien](https://www.samjulien.com/)

<YouTube youTubeId="GdsKB6_6pdk" />

As a big fan of Gatsby, I tried to implement auth in the past. I made it work, but it was never a clear and obvious process. Thanks to my Auth0 colleague [Sam Julien](https://www.samjulien.com/), I was able to implement quicker and more up-to-date auth in a [side-project](https://dseapps.dev/) I'm playing around with (it's really early days).

## From create-react-app to create-any-app â€” [Ema Suriano](https://emasuriano.com/)

<YouTube youTubeId="ilgM9RmaUGg" />

This is a pretty awesome one. In fact, I've been thinking about something like this for a while but didn't really know how to approach it and where to start. Thanks to [Ema Suriano](https://emasuriano.com/), now I know :)
