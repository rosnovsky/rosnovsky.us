The Heather Lake trail is located in the North Cascades' [Mt. Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest](https://www.fs.usda.gov/mbs), one of the most visited forests in the country. The trail itself goes over ancestral lands of the [Stillaguamish](https://www.stillaguamish.com/about-us/) people, and climbs along and across the hill, mostly along the Heather creek. The trail features old-growth forest, waterfalls, a few streams along, across, and on the trail, and finally a fairly nice lake in a quite spectacular setting.

![Obligatory lunch. It's funny, this time I forgot my silverware (spork) and my fine china (stove cap which doubles as a bowl). As a result, I used the pouch as a bowl and my knife as a spork.
