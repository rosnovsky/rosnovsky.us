Just wanted to throw together some things that help me and may help you enjoy the physical distancing a little more.

## TV and Movies

- [Apple TV+All Apple Originals](https://tv.apple.com/)  
  Apple TV+ offers Apple's original shows without a subscription
- [Stream Free Episodes of HBO Series Online](https://www.hbo.com/watch-free-episode)  
  HBO has offered a bunch of free episodes and documentaries
- [Quibi - Quick bites](https://quibi.com/)  
  Quibi offers a 90-day free trial. (**UPDATE**: In October 2020, [Quibi shut down](/blog/quibi-is-sutting-down).)

### Scrubs

My all-time favorite show. It resonates, even more, these days.

Stream on [Hulu](https://www.hulu.com/series/scrubs-bba197b5-eb03-4a09-b5f6-f04c053471d7?entity_id=ef61c04b-89de-4559-a010-57be02dfe583)

### World War Z

A really cool movie about ~~Codid-19~~ zombie outbreak.

Rent or buy [anywhere](https://decider.com/movie/world-war-z/)

### Outbreak

A little naive and fairly old movie about an outbreak of a virus in a particular city.

Stream on [Netflix](https://www.netflix.com/watch/834585)

### Contagion

If you ever wondered if anyone ever predicted Covid-19 outbreak, wonder no more. This movie is strikingly accurate when it comes to what we are experiencing today. Pretty fascinating!

Rent [anywhere](https://decider.com/movie/contagion/)

## Games

If you're a gamer, definitely try [**Ori and the Will of the Wisps**](https://www.orithegame.com/). It's a fantastic game, but I couldn't play it â€” it got too complex for my non-gamer taste. But you will enjoy it, I promise!

Ori and the Heartbreak of Non-Gamers

### Sayonara Wild Hearts

Fantastic, dynamic, beautiful, and quick. Challenging enough to keep you entertained, but casual enough to be played, well, casually.

## Video Happy hours

[Happy Hour with @rosnovsky](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/103618537836?aff=efbneb)

Consider this an invitation to a casual ad-hoc happy hour! Bring beer, coffee, Red Bull, or soup. Pajamas ok, pants are highly recommended :)

## Podcasts and such

Going for a walk? Quick workout? Cooking something? Put on a podcast and get twice the fun!

## Conferences & Meetups

It's interesting how conferences adapt to this new reality. And I must say, most are doing a fantastic job transitioning to 100% online. Some still charge quite a lot, some are very flexible (pay-per-track, pay for VOD, or only pay for workshops, for example), and some gone completely free. Well, my conference budget just got waaaay more flexible as well. I think, I'm going to attend them all **BECAUSE I CAN** ðŸ˜‚

## Bonus: Home improvement projects

Nah, I'm not the kind of person who's into DIY. But I've got a pretty serious urge to make our back room into a proper office and _lounge_ space.
