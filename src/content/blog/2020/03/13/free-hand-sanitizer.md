ðŸ”¥ GIVE BLOOD â€” GET HAND SANITIZER\* ðŸ”¥

Running low on hand sanitizer? [**Bloodworks Northwest**](https://www.bloodworksnw.org/) got you covered! _Inquire locally about toilet paper availability._

You also get juice, a bunch of cookies, and oh, you may also save a life or two. But let's keep it real. I mean, come on, people, it's free HAND SANITIZER!

- as many "pumps" as necessary, on-site use only

Yes, YES, it's really as simple as it sounds.

But on a serious note, blood donation centers are running extremely low on blood now, especially in areas most hit by the virus. Please, if you are healthy and have a car, consider stopping by and giving blood. It's quick, painless, healthy, and sterile. And have I mentioned FREE HAND SANITIZER?! :)
