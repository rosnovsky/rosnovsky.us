## New Home

It's been a long month. I've been working from a lawn chair in our new home while folks were ripping off old floors and installing new ones. Working from a lawn chair may sound like a blast but it isn't. My back hurts, and since it's pretty much the only piece of furniture in the house, there aren't many options where else I can sit. The noise isn't exactly helping either, but I manage.

The floors were in pretty terrible condition, and it looks and feels so much nicer already!

With this being said, there's so much more to be done here. Paint the walls, replace a couple of windows, replace most interior doors, remodel the kitchen, and don't even get me started on the bathrooms!..

All in all, we knew exactly what we were in for with this house, and so far it's been better than expected.

## Moving out

We've moved 10 times and lived in 3 different countries in the past 15 years or so. We are used to moving; we used to move almost every year. Our current place is where we stayed the longest, since 2018. And we were planning on staying here until 2022, but hey, when you get to buy a house, your plans change. We are breaching our lease agrement (and paying extravagant amount of money to do so) and moving out on Tuesday. It's funny how rental advacates always mention that when you rent, it's easier for you to just move; somehow, they always forget about how lease agreements work. In our case, we are basically on the hook for a $2120 lease breaching fee AND we are responsible for paying rent until February 2022 unless a new tenant moves in. On top of that, we cannot live in the apartment even though we will be paying rent. In my personal experience, owning a house gives you significantly more flexibility to just sell it and move.

It's also worth mentioning that due to work and renovations at the new home, we haven't started packing yet. As of this moment, we have 4 days to pack the entire 2-bedroom + office townhouse. It's going to be stressful 4 days, for sure. Oh, and it's going to be **HOT**!
