In Antarctica, researchers discover a mysterious structure, buried in ice.

In a lab in Jakarta, an autism researcher identifies a revolutionary treatment that could change everything.

But these two incredible discoveries aren't what they seem. They will set off a race to unravel the deepest secrets of human existence--and an event that could change humanity forever.
