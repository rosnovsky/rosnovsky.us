Jasmine "Jazz" Bashara, a small-time smuggler in Artemis, the only lunar colony, jumps at the chance for a big score to escape her cramped life. As she upgrades to criminal mastermind, she finds herself entangled in a conspiracy to control Artemis. With both a killer and the law after her, Jazz must pull off an epic scheme to survive and save her city. "Artemis" blends science, suspense, and humor in a high-stakes lunar heist story.
