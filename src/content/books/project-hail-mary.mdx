Ryland Grace wakes up alone on a spaceship, millions of miles from Earth, with no memory and two dead crewmates. As his memories slowly return, he realizes he's on a mission to solve an extinction-level threat to humanity. Racing against time and isolated in space, he must unravel scientific mysteries to save Earth. But is he really alone? "Project Hail Mary" is a high-stakes, interstellar survival story from the author of "The Martian."
