        I'm a web developer based in Western Washington. I live about 50 miles
        north of Seattle in a small town called Arlington.

        For a while, I lived in London (not that one, but the one in Ontario,
        Canada) before moving to Vancouver (not that one, but the one in
        Washington; not that Washington, but Washington state). Now I live in
        Arlington (and not the one in Virginia, mind you!)

        After short gigs at Intel, AT&T, and Microsoft, I ended up at <a
          class="underline"
          href="https://auth0.com/">Auth0</a
        > (acquired by Okta in May 2021). I worked there in a couple of different
        roles, the latest one being `Software Engineer`. I've built Auth0's enterprise
        customer onboarding program, surrounding internal and external tooling, a
        bunch of high-profile customer facing features, and more. I was laid off
        in February 2024.

        For the longest time, I'd been a podcaster. In my previous life, I even
        was a minor radio celebrity, worked as a television producer and
        correspondent, and have done a bunch of front-line reporting from
        terrorist attacks, riots, and hostage situations. Yet here we are.
