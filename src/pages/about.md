title: 'Hey, my name is Art.'

I'm a web developer based in Western Washington. I live about 50 miles north of Seattle in a small town called Arlington.

> For a while, I lived in London (not that one, but the one in Ontario, Canada) before moving to Vancouver (not that one, but the one in Washington; not that Washington, but Washington state). Now I live in Arlington (and not the one in Virginia, mind you!)

After short gigs at Intel, AT&T, and Microsoft, I ended up at [Auth0](https://auth0.com/) (acquired by [Okta](https://okta.com) in May 2021). I worked there in a couple of different roles, the latest one being `Software Engineer`. I've built Auth0's enterprise customer onboarding program, surrounding internal and external tooling, a bunch of high-profile customer facing features, and more. I was laid off in February 2024.

Feel free to connect with me on [Mastodon](https://lounge.town/@rosnovsky) or [Github](https://github.com/rosnovsky).

> For the longest time, I'd been a podcaster. In my previous life, I even was a minor radio celebrity, worked as a television producer and correspondent, and have done a bunch of front-line reporting from terrorist attacks, riots, and hostage situations. Yet here we are.
