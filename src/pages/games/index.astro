        Unlike with <a href="/library">books</a>, I don't have a specific genre
        I like to play. I've got about 130 games in my Steam library, but here
        I'll only list the ones I've played for a while and really enjoyed.
      </p>

        I've got a total of <strong>{games.length} favorite games</strong> from <strong
          >{new Set(games.map((book) => book.data.studio.slug)).size} studios</strong
        > in my library.
