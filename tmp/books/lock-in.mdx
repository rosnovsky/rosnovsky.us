In the near future, a virus called Haden's syndrome leaves a small percentage of people "locked in"—fully conscious but paralyzed. The world adapts, creating a new normal. Rookie FBI agent Chris Shane teams up with veteran Leslie Vann to solve a murder at the Watergate Hotel. The suspect, an "integrator," complicates the case by potentially hosting a paralyzed Haden client. As they dig deeper, Shane and Vann discover the case is just the tip of an iceberg, involving corporate greed and a shifting culture among the locked-in population. It's a twisty investigation where nothing is as it seems.
