In recent days, I was brutally humbled into this realization that I have not a clue about what’s going on in this country. I've been calling America my home for the past 8 years, but apparently, I know _nothing_ about its history, culture, struggles, and pain; how it came about, who built it, and what happened along the way. I’ve been looking for resources that could help me learn and understand more. I want to share some of these resources: I can’t be the only person who had no idea how deep and systemic racism is in America and elsewhere.

> There are many, many more fantastic resources to get you started. I should probably catalog them in a more organized format.

## Seeing White

Phenomenal podcast series, must-listen. Uncomfortable, painful, enraging, humbling.

## Dismantling White Supremacy And The 5 Stages of Grief

As straightforward as it sounds. Most importantly, prevents you from fucking up unnecessarily in the very beginning of your journey.

## Uncomfortable Conversations with a Black Man

After going through other resources first, this video didn't feel as uncomfortable as it might've been just a week ago. But make no mistake: this is not something that's going to validate your "not-racism".

## How to Be an Antiracist

An essential how-to for White people on going from being a harmful “I’m not a racist” (basically, just a racist but with extra steps) to becoming, in fact, an anti-racist.

## Algorithms of Oppression: How Search Engines Reinforce Racism

This one is directly applicable to what we as an industry do. It's really no just about search engines, but about everything we do in tech.

## 13th (2016)

A movie set free by Netflix and available on Youtube now. Disheartening and shocking.

## The Hate U Give

Inspired by a true story. By any true story of an unarmed Black person being killed by police with impunity. I haven't watched a movie, but it exists and available as well: [The Hate U Give (2018)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXy0H-EZR5s)

## How to Be Black

Funny and light yet brutally honest, as most things [Baratunde](https://www.baratunde.com/) does.

[How to Be Black](https://bookshop.org/books/how-to-be-black/9780062003225?aid=8136)

## Just Mercy (2020)

Free for a limited time on the Apple platform. A story of a backward justice system, in which justice is a privilege defined by the color of your skin.

## Salute (2008)

Many have seen this famous picture: three athletes, two of them Black with their fists raised. But there's so much more to this story.
