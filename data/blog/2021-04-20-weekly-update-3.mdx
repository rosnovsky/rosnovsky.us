This one is a bit late and shorter than usual. 

## House Hunting Is Over

It’s been about three weeks since we started looking for a house in earnest. Mission accomplished. By the end of week three we signed a contract and we are working on a laundry list of next steps. Long story short, we are moving quite a bit to the north of where we live now — we are moving to Arlington. 

> Coast Salish people from prehistoric times, primarily of the Stillaguamish Tribe, stopped to camp at the forks [of the Stillaguamish River] as they passed up and down the river following the abundant fish runs and otherwise using the river as a primary travel corridor. The Stillaguamish called the place Skabalko.

The house itself is pretty nice, but requires a lot of interior work. Still, it looks like a nice place to live. My head is occupied by all the house projects, dozens of them. Gotta work on keeping myself sane and going overboard, and it won’t be easy :))

## Family is in town

Some of the bright spots in immigrant’s life are those when you get to see your family. This year is special in many respects, and especially because some of my family members will be becoming permanent residents here in the U.S. And while I’m working on the rest of the plan, step one just got complete: my mom just landed as a resident here! Moreover, today she got her first Covid vaccine shot, so there’s that. Again, pretty hard to contain my excitement :)

I promise to do better next week, but for now I’m just going to get back to all this all-consuming stuff. Cheers!
