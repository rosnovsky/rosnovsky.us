Some of you know that this blog has a membership feature. I'm not really using it yet, but it's set up and ready to roll!

Most posts in this blog are available publicly. However, there are a few things why you should still [join the free tier](https://rosnovsky.us/signup).

Free tier helps us connect for real. I know why you are, and you know what's new in the blog as it happens. It's that easy. I do collect some information from my members, and it's [fully disclosed here](https://rosnovsky.us/blog/2020/05/07/how-i-collect-your-data/) along with all the ways I use this data (spoiler: I collect very little data about you and only use it for the essential functionality of this blog).

Eventually, some posts will be "For Members Only". My most personal and controversial stuff will be behind this free membership. Basically, it's becoming a more private conversation between you and me.

I've got a trove of ideas, and I'm working on some of them right now. I'll make videos, run live streams, live coding sessions, podcasts, happy hours, Q&As, call-in talk shows, live chat — all these things will be behind [paid membership](https://rosnovsky.us/account).

![You can upgrade your membership in your account.](https://cdn.sanity.io/images/n3o7a5dl/production/ba292444aeb855d782029d53f4ba0efcab9cd767-1570x1384.png)

Paid memberships are safe, secure, and easy to cancel at any moment. I encourage you to consider joining the [Free Tier](https://rosnovsky.us/signup) and eventually upgrading. Your upgrades are the best indication of your interest, support, and the direction I'm taking.
