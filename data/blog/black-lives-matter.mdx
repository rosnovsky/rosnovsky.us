I can't believe this has to be said out loud again and again in 2020.

I can't believe some people find this controversial.

I can't believe some people are more outraged by property damage than by routine murders of unarmed black Americans by the police that go unpunished.

I can't believe someone can be a white supremacist, racist or nationalist and not be shunned by society.

Racism is bad. Racists are bad.

A wise man once said: "_A riot is the language of the unheard_". I wholeheartedly support protests around the country. If you have to riot, do what you have to do. Try to be safe. Avoid hurting local small businesses if possible. Stand up for your community. Make sure you are heard by any means necessary.

I don't post about civil matters too often. But sometimes I just can't keep quiet.
