summary: "2020 was a year of, among other things, missed concerts. I missed live music so much that as soon as I got a chance to go to concerts again, I went nuts."

In a normal year, my wife and I would go to 5-10 live concerts. Not only it's something that we love and do, but also something that we can hardly live without. It's not a huge streatch to say that last year sucked in this regard. I recognize that we are very fortunate to have "live concerts" as one of the biggest dissapointments of 2020. 

Anyway, as vaccination rates soared in Washington state in general and in our counties in particular, many restrictions on public events were lifted. Now sitting at about 80% of the population fully vaccinated, it seemed like as good time as any to get back to live music (and other events, eventually).

As soon as I got a chance, I got tickets to a few concerts; In a way, I overcorrected for the entire year without live music, and got tickets to four shows happening in a span of a month. Two down, two more to go.

## Hella Mega Tour

Green Day is one of my all-time favorite bands. "Wake Me Up When September Ends" is one of my all-time favorite songs. Fall Out Boy is one of my other all-time favorites. Naturally, they were on a must-see list for a while, but circumstances were never in my favor. Until this September.

Hella Mega Tour was supposed to stop by in Seattle in July 2020. Obviously, it was postponed and later rescheduled, and until the very day of the show, I wasn't sure it won't be postponed again (with Delta variant and all). 

The show opened with Weezer set. I'm not a fan, but there are a couple of songs that I like.
