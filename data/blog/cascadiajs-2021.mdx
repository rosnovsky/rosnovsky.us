## General takeaways

- If you want to attend a virual conference, take time off work to do so. I've been making a mistake of watching talks on a second screen while working in the past; never again. Engaging, being fully emerged, and being able to take notes without the disttruction of work is priceless.
- Taking notes is key. Watching passively is fun and all, but if you really want to take something away from the presentation, take notes.
- If you're attending a workshop, don't think that a question you have is stupid or irrelevant; others have this same question as well, or had this question in the past. ASK AWAY!
- If you're following along during a workshop and something goes wrong, figure out whether it's something you can fix later. If so, keep following along and fix the issue later. Just assume that everything is working as presented. However, if it's something you can't fix or don't know how to fix, absolutely ASK FOR HELP!
> During the dApps workshop this year, I had an issue with RedwoodJS and couldn't get it to work. Since the focus of the workshop was to get a smart contract on the local Ethereum network, I focused on this part and was able to replace Redwood with Next later to get things working.
- Doodle if you can. Cascadia had this awesome live graphic recordings that were not only incredibely helpful and fun to watch, but it also inspired me to explore "doodling" as a way to take notes.
- If you feel lost, take a break and re-watch the talk later. It's a great way to get back in the flow and get back to the point.
- HAVE FUN!
