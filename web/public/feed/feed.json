            "content_html": "Despite my best efforts, I'm turning 40 today. It's a somber day for me, as I'm another year older...\n\nNah, just kidding. It's literally just a number, and I'm totally comfortable with it :) My back hurts, but it's been like this for decades so no changes here.\n\nStill, I want to tally up some things. You know, \"Zukerberg is a quadrillionair, and what have you achieved?!\" kind of thing.\n\nFirst, the best way to be permanently unhappy is to compare yourself to others. Not gonna happen; it only makes sense to compare yourself to yourself yesterday.\n\nSecond, I'm doing fine. I've got my family, a place to live (and call my own at that!), a job I like, and a bunch of hobbies. I have my books, my journals, and a fire pit in my backyard. I do my little things trying to make the world a better place even if in a small way.\n\n\n\nI was born in the Soviet Union, lived most of my adult life in Russia, moved to Canada, then to the U.S., and made it here too. In total, I've moved ~13 times since turning 18 (including 2 immigrations). I've made some friends along the way, and only a few enemies.\n\nI almost got my private pilot license (and I still may get it at some point). I hiked around a volcano, piloted an airplane over the Hoover Dam, joined, started and failed a few businesses, and had a podcast for over 14 years. I helped a few good people meet each other, and I'm mostly proud of folks in my close circle.\n\nI'd worked as a paper delivery carrier, a reporter (and a front-line one at that), an editor of a magazine, radio host, editor, producer, DJ; I'd been a college student in my 30s and the oldest person in my class. I'd been unemployed, been a landlord, a contractor at three different Fortune 50 companies, and a full-time software engineer.\n\n\n\nMost importantly, I'm not embarrassed by how I live my life. I stand with those less privileged and less fortunate than me. I think I'm on the side of justice more often than not, and I'm not afraid of the future generations' eventual scrutiny of my life. I try to live my life honestly, give back whenever I can, and I'm convinced that this is a big part of why I'm so organically comfortable with myself. I've got a head full of gray hair, and I'm going bald, and it's ok with me :)\n\nHere's to the next 40 years!\n\nP.S. Obligatory \"get off my lawn, you darn kids\"! Going to buy a Harley, a leather jacket and suspenders, and join other old farts in bitching about the good old days. Just watch me! :))\n\nP.P.S. As a \"class of '99\" person, I should've really used more sunscreen :)",

            "content_html": "2021 was a very long year. In part because we didn't get to decompress after 2020, in part because a lot of 2020 stayed with us through the entire 2021, and in part because of a bunch of personal stuff that happened.\n\nAs you may or may not know, in my family the New Year is the holiday of the season. When most people are taking down their house decorations, we are just putting them up (to avoid confusion, we mostly decorate inside): the New Year tree, presents, and such. For the past few years we decided against exchanging gifts for the sake of the exchange: there's enough garbage in the world for us to buy some more just because of a calendar date and just because we have to.\n\nIn any case, the end of the year is not only the biggest holiday of the year for me, but also a time to reflect on the year, take stock of my progress, and make plans for the year ahead.\n\nAmerican democracy is (likely) doomed\n\nThe year that begins with an insurrection is not a good year for American democracy. The year when the insurrection and an earnest coup attempt by an outgoing president and his entire administration is even worse. But the worst part is that this failed coup attempt did not result in a unanimous, bipartisan, unequivocal condemnation. I mean, sure the FBI is working on it, hundreds of insurgents are being arrested and charged, but the overall response by the political class and by the nation in general was flaccid at best.\n\nI've seen countries fall in a blink of an eye. I personally witnessed it twice: once in 1991 when I watched tanks heading towards Moscow during the August Coup, and then about a decade later when Putin started to usurp power in earnest and began turning Russia back into Soviet Union. While there were major differences in the way these two events unfolded, they were similar in many ways: they both led to unraveling of the country.\n\nIf you think that the American flavor of democracy is somehow immune to these things, think again. It's not, it may and in all likelihood will happen here. And with one of (only) two major parties making every effort to prevent their opponents from voting, and the other party being so anemic while running the government, the American Democracy¬Æ and the entire American Experiment‚Ñ¢ is all but doomed. We will see this country disintegrate within our lifetimes, and it makes me very sad #EndTheFilibuster #VotingRightsBIllNow #EatTheRich\n\nWhile resistance is futile, I joined the Democratic Socialists of America to see if I can make the best out of this unfortunate situation.\n\nCOVID remained a factor\n\nWhile a lot of things got back to some variation of \"normal\", for the most part this year was still a full-on pandemic year. Hundreds of thousands of people died of COVID-19, albeit most of them deliberately unvaccinated. People kept struggling to get their jobs back, and the economy was still in a state of flux. It's important to remember that the economy is not the stock market, and that the stock market is not the economy (and not even necessarily reflective or the economy). The struggle is real, and it's much more real for those essential for the actual economy. With this being said, the labor shortage got some bargaining power in the hands of the working class, which is without a doubt a great thing.\n\nFor my family the pandemic kept affecting our plans, specifically, our plans of getting together. With embassies closed or working at limited capacity and with other government agencies significantly underperforming, a lot of our long-term plans were (and still are) in jeopardy.\n\nPersonally, I'm extremely privileged and lucky to be in a position of not being affected by the pandemic. I work from home at a company that gives a shit about me (not personally, but as an employee). When Auth0 was acquired by Okta in the spring of this year, it benefited me a lot. Financially, it was a good year for me as well. So much so that I've got to buy a house.\n\nWe bought a house\n\nThis is probably the biggest event of the year for me. In early January, I sold my rental house in Georgia (with a written provision in the contract that my tenants will be able to remain in the house and their rent will not change for at least another year), and with some financial luck that followed the acquisition of Auth0, I was able to come up with about 10%-worth of downpayment and buy a house for us here in Arlington, WA. It's not a dream house by any stretch of imagination, but it's our house and we're turning it into a home.\n\nWork got... interesting\n\nWork was, well, interesting this year. I've accepted another role within the company, but it turned out to be a complicated affair. I got to work on a new process and a new team, which was pretty awesome. However, a lot of my initial assumptions and working theories were wrong, and by the end of the year our team shifted from its initial purpose to a new one. I'm building a net-new product, and as much as I love coding, its success is still an open question. On the bright side, I learn a lot and my team is pretty great.\n\nWhat I learned\n\nTypeScript and scaffolding and building new products\n\nCreating two open-source projects that hundreds of people use every day was fun (check out Sanity Autocomplete Tags and Current Apple Music)\n\nFamily is everything\n\nIt's possible to improve one's mental health by prioritizing it over work\n\nAnalog is the shit: I journal, take notes, plan on paper, and it's been a smashing success\n\nWin of the Year\n\nA family member landed in the US as a permanent resident, and, well, buying a house.\n\nFail of the Year\n\nMy failure to recognize mental health warning signs in time, and my inability to act decisively to get to work on things I want to work on.\n\nWhat I'm looking forward to in 2022\n\nMy expectations for 2022 are really, really low. I hope to rectify this year's failures, keep working on my mental health, rest way more than I'm used to, and hopefully travel a bit more. I also hope to attend a few conferences and give a talk at one of them :) I mean, reach for the stars, am I right?!",

Yet its main purpose - it's a blog, damn it! - happens to be mostly neglected.\n\nThis fact (\"I don't use my blog for, well, blogging\") made me think about why do I even have this site. I mean, sure, it's been around forever, in different shapes, forms, and even domains; I used to host my podcasts here, post hot political takes, and other stuff. I don't do this anymore, so the question is: what is this website? What's its purpose?\n\nNo matter how rare the blog posts are, I still write them. I write them for a couple of reasons: to capture a thought or something I learned or something helpful that I use, to record an experience I had,or to practice my writing skills. It happens roughly once a month, but it's ok, nobody really expects me to post anything anyway :)\n\nSo while this is a blog, blogging is really a side effect of... what? I struggled to put it into words until I saw Michelle Bakels' talk at CascadiaJS earlier this year. (my takeaways from the conference itself are here).\n\nThe idea of meditation through code is fascinating to me. I've been doing it for so long without realizing what it was. I very much do most of the work on this website as a form of meditation.\n\nI set on a feature I want to add (take Last Played song, for example). Nobody needs this feature, not even me. But it's not about the feature, you see. It's about the process.\n\nI research it without any time pressure, just for fun. I could get on a week-long detour because there's something interesting that came out of the research and I want to follow that before getting back to the task at hand. It's about the process.\n\nI don't care if I make it right, or if I make it at all. It's the process that captivates me, keeps me in my head, calms me down. It's more about the process than the result.\n\nI don't feel guilty if I abandon an idea or a feature. It was about the process, and it served its purpose.\n\nI do feel extra gratification when I'm pushing something I've done in the process, and the feature or improvement I've been meditating on becomes public (take comments below, for example).\n\nIt's all about the process!\n\nAll of it. The main reason I have this site, the main reason I post here occasionally, the only reason I'm working on obscure features and improvements is the process itself. It's all about the journey, not the destination.\n\nThis realization was extremely liberating. It removed whatever pressure I felt I had on myself to do something, to write something, to post, commit, push and merge. None of it matters, not really. What matters is that I get time and headspace for myself, and coding this website is how I do it.\n\nIt's not art per se (although sometimes I look at it and feel genuine aesthetic joy), it's not really helping others (although, again, some posts and code did help folks). This is about me, doing my thing, using code to get in the flow, to express myself creatively, and to be kind to myself.\n\nSo here goes: the purpose of this website is to be a place where I can write and meditate through code. That's it.\n\nAs a bonus, here's a sketchnote of Michelle's talk. Prior to this, I didn't even know sketchnoting was a thing. Now I do, and I find it fascinating. TO learn more, check out Mind's Eye Creative website. Ashton also offers a great course on sketchnoting! I've been enjoying it so far, and you will too!",

            "content_html": "For years I wanted to attend CascadiaJS 2021, a PNW-native JavaScript conference. And for a while, I either couldn't afford it, didn't have the time, or had more immediate priorities.\n\nFinally, this year everything clicked in place: Auth0 helped me with the ticket, I was able to take time off to attend, and nothing else got in the way.\n\nIt was a blast! Worth every penny, every minute, and I'm so glad I attended. Fantastic speakers, incredible community, family vibes, and a lot of fun - this is CascadiaJS I've enjoyed this year.\n\nI've got a few general takeaways, a bunch of specific things I want to share, and some notes on what I learned.\n\nAll talks, slides, and graphic recordings will be available on CascadiaJS 2021 website within the next couple of weeks. Don't miss it!\n\nGeneral takeaways\n\nIf you want to attend a virtual conference, take time off work to do so. I've been making the mistake of watching talks on a second screen while working in the past; never again. Engaging, being fully emerged, and being able to take notes without the distraction of work is priceless.\n\nTaking notes is key. Watching passively is fun and all, but if you really want to take something away from the presentation, take notes. Not going to lie, I love taking notes, but I bet you'll find it to be valuable too!\n\nIf you're attending a workshop, don't think that a question you have is stupid or irrelevant; others have this same question as well, or had this question in the past. ASK AWAY!\n\nIf you're following along during a workshop and something goes wrong, figure out whether it's something you can fix later. If so, keep following along and fix the issue later. Just assume that everything is working as presented. However, if it's something you can't fix or don't know how to fix, absolutely ASK FOR HELP! This is the entire reason for the workshop in question!\n\nDuring the dApps workshop this year, I had an issue with RedwoodJS and couldn't get it to work. Since the focus of the workshop was to get a smart contract on the local Ethereum network, I focused on this part and was able to replace Redwood with Next later to get things working.\n\nDoodle if you can. Cascadia had these awesome live graphic recordings that were not only incredibly helpful and fun to watch, but they also inspired me to explore \"doodling\" as a way to take notes. The recorder was amazing Ashton Rodenhiser, and I will be taking her course \"Sketchnote All the Things\" as soon as I can.\n\nIf you feel lost, take a break and re-watch the talk later. There's no point in trying to understand something while falling behind, getting frustrated and discouraged, and giving up. Take a break, get some water, make a note of what got you off track, and come back to it later.\n\nHAVE FUN! And I can't stress this enough: H A V E F U N! You could watch speakers give talks on youtube any day of the year, but having them in the room, available for live Q&A, with other like-minded people around is the stuff.\n\nSpecifics\n\nLike it or not, blockchain is here to stay. It's not going away, and if you're in the tech space, you will have to either use it, work on it, or develop for it sometime in the foreseeable future.\n\nResponsive Components are coming to the CSS spec soon. You'll be able to make specific boxes responsive, not just the whole page. And by responsive, I don't just mean size, but also font sizes, colors, layouts - all the things you'd normally have to do to make a website responsive, just for individual components.\n\nThe most basic things can give you an expansive space for experimentation. Think `window.open()`: apparently, there's a whole world there, and you can use it in many fun ways.\n\nIf you want to learn something, give a talk about it. If you don't want to do it in public, make it an internal talk and give it to your team.\n\nField data > Lighthouse. Web Vitals all things, and track performance based on real user experience.\n\nWASM is still an enigma to me. Aaron Turner did a great job of explaining it, but I got lost and will try again later. Perhaps, I just don't have a real use-case for it yet and thus its value escapes me.\n\nThere are some basic things you need to learn about JS before learning React, but you can learn them while learning React. I mean, React pays the bills, but you have better chances of success if you're learning JS basics as soon as you can.\n\nSmart contracts are basically just functions that require a compatible blockchain to run on. It's not rocket science, but given that there are dozens of blockchains, and Ehtereum being ridiculously expensive, you may spend a lot of time learning specific implementations of smart contracts (think Solidity). Start with Solidity and go from there.\n\nSensible encapsulation with React Hooks could make your life more DRY, but you'd need to really think what to encapsulate and how.\n\nThere are super fun things to play with. With ML widely available to the JS developers (think TensorJS, ML5, etc.), you can make all sorts of cool things based, for example, on computer vision. Some of these things have huge real-world value. For example, gaze detection could be used by people with mobility limitations to not only navigate apps but also to build them. I personally use computer vision to add `alt` text to images on this site. It's not perfect, but it's a start.\n\nIf you brush the cryptocurrency hype off of blockchain concepts, you'll end up with the core of Web3. Web3 in many ways is a return to Web's roots of being decentralized, but with a ton of control in the hands of the users. \"Open Web: this time we mean it\".\n\nYou should treat your internal tools as production software, and your teammates are your customers. Think of their experience as DX you want to provide.\n\nRefactoring and code migrations are \"human work\" more than \"code work\". Buy-in, marketing, and support of your refactoring work are not optional.\n\nTypescript is a wild beast and you need to hunt it down! :)\n\nSeriously, though: a lot of Typescript looks beyond intimidating sometimes, but if you dissect and expand it, you'll find it easier to understand.\n\nIf you're interested in cartography on the Web, begin with exploring data layer and UI layer concepts, vector tiles, and GeoJSON. Another interesting thing to think about is that maps should be responsive in all three dimensions(xyz), not just two as is the case with websites.\n\nWhatever tool you're building, you have to think about how it will be used to abuse others (not if it will be used for abuse). You must figure out a balance between privacy and safety, and it's a hell of a task.\n\nNPM and the entire JS ecosystem is wild: this site, for example, relies on thousands of packages created by thousands of people, and I have to trust the entire supply chain. We had issues with this sort of thing in the past, and supply chain attacks are not going away. There are tools that can help, though, and tracking simple things (like typos in package names) is a good start.\n\nI missed two awesome talks and I'll update this page as I get them.\n\nCascadiaJS 2022\n\nI don't know if I'll be able to make it, but that's the plan.\n\nNotes\n\nDay 1\n\nDay 2",

            "content_html": "This whole thing requires that you have an active paid Apple Developer account. It's $100/yr and is not worth it unless you plan on using it for something else besides \"current music\"\n\nApple Music is my primary music service. I do listen to Spotify every now and again (their recommendation engine is unmatched), but being an Apple household, it makes sense to mostly use Apple Music.\n\nWhen I started working on this blog, I took a lot of inspiration from Lee Robinson. He has this little Spotify widget displaying the current song, and while it was easy to adapt and use it, it was not what I wanted. What I wanted was a widget displaying the last song I listened to on Apple Music. Which, apparently, is not trivial.\n\nApple Music API\n\nFor the longest time, I couldn't find a way to use Apple's MusicKit or Music API on the web. Their developer documentation is pretty poor, especially when it comes to the web stuff. At last, I figured that I'm looking for the user listening history, and there's an API endpoint for that.\n\nThis endpoint requires two different authorization tokens: the developer token & user music token. With the Developer token, one could query and perform actions within the Music store. And with the user music token, one could query and perform actions within the user's music library. So, how do you get those?\n\nGetting tokens\n\nNow, the deal with the two tokens is that they are totally different, unrelated, yet somewhat connected: You need both in order to fetch music history.\n\nThe developer token is a JWT that you build yourself, and sign with a private key you get at the Apple developer portal. More on this here.\n\nThe user music token appears to be some kind of opaque token, which you can only get after a user explicitly logs into their Apple Music account and grants your app access to their Apple Music account. So far, I was unable to find a way to generate or obtain this token programmatically. What's worse, this token expires after 6 months (fixed) and there's no way to renew it.\n\nThis last bit matters because, in this whole equation, you can generate the developer token yourself. You can obtain the user music token. But from here, you cannot update the user token, so in 6 months you'll have to generate a new one, in the browser, by logging in, manually, as some sort of animal.\n\nFinally, it's a quest to figure out how to get this user token, and crappy docs don't really help. Here's how you do it:\n\nScaffold an HTML page with a <script> tag pointing to the MusicKit script\n\nAdd the \"Sign in with Apple\" button to the page (here's how)\n\nDeploy the app (to Vercel or Netlify, or wherever, otherwise you'd have to work around a bunch of issues)\n\nLog in on this newly deployed page, grant it access to your Apple Music account\n\nOpen Developer Tools, and in the \"Storage\" section find the token OR add <script>console.log(response)</script> to the page and just copy the token from the console.\n\nNot very intuitive, but it works. Now you have 6 months to use this token, and after that, you'd need to do the same thing again.\n\nAs for the Developer token, I used Auth0's jsonwebtoken library. It allows you to both sign and verifies JWT tokens. I store my private and public keys in environment variables, and sign the token like this:\n\nThat's about it. Now, that you've got both tokens, everything else is pretty straightforward.\n\nFetching Last Played songs\n\nThe API itself is fairly conventional. The only specific thing about it is that it's poorly documented (you don't know for sure what shape the response object will be for different resources) and the fact that you need to supply both Bearer token for Authorization header and a user-music-token as a different header. \n\nWith both tokens in hand, it might look something like this:\n\nIn response you'll get something like this:\n\nKeep in mind that this shape is not set in stone, and some songs will have all these attributes, some will not (at least that was the case for me).\n\nShowing off\n\nFinally, you'd want to show visitors what you've got. This is the easy part (haha).\n\nI'm a huge fan of SWR - Stale While Revalidate. It's a great way to cache data, refetch stale data, and just generally have a robust way of updating things every now and then without reloading the page or requiring a user action.\n\nHere's the most basic example:\n\nHere I request that SWR refetches new data regularly, refetches it on focus (if a user scrolls away from the Now Playing component, or switches to a different tab and comes back), and refetches data on reconnect (if the user's connection is lost, and reconnects).\n\nThe `fetcher` function is a simple wrapper around `fetch` that returns a promise:\n\nI pass the data to the Track component for rendering:\n\nThat's about it. The result looks like this:\n\nThat's about it. Oh, I've also went ahead and spun up a repo for this specific thing, feel free to check it out: current-apple-music. This one generates an image of the current song playing on Apple Music that you can use in your website or in your Github profile's README ;)",

Arguably, it's not too profound or deep or insightful, so it's totally fine; it's obscure by design, I guess.\n\nAnd yet, it's still writing in public. And coding in public. And I've been working on comments to make it possible for you to leave whatever feedback you may have. However, recently I started journaling in private, just for myself. And on paper, with a pen. Like an animal.\n\nThere's something truly liberating in writing for noone. I forgot how it feels; I used to keep a journal in high school, but then life happened and I've never got back to journaling since. There was a few months of Bullet Journaling, but it ended when I broke my leg.\n\nThis time, I've been transitioning into more mindful work and life. As a part of this transition, I've been moving away from many digital tools that I've been using for years towards their analog analogs (see what I did here?) I'm running a paper-only to-do list, I track time with a physical timer, I'm taking meeting notes in a notepad, I'm planning work on paper, and finally, I'm keeping a journal. I'll talk about all these other things sometime later, but for now, I'm going to focus on the journal.\n\nJournal\n\nI've got like a dozen different notebooks, notepads, journals and composition books. I wanted to make this habit last, and knowing myself well enough, I knew that I had to try everything that I may potentially like before settling on one \"perfect\" journal.\n\nMeet Leuchtturm1917 Composition Notebook B5 (soft cover).\n\nIt's fantastically simple and plain, nothing fancy, really. But I love it. So much so that I've got two more - for the future.\n\nThe pages are nice and clean with a hint of creme (they are not bright white, which is great). They are ruled, numbered, and have a space for the date/topic. The pages are also great for fountain pens, they allow very little bleeding and are very easy to write on. Two string bookmarks to keep things easily accessible is another nice feature of this Leuchtturm1917. Finally, the cover is soft but thick enough to protect the journal. There's also, of course, a pocket at the end cover.\n\nPens\n\nPens have been an obsession for me for a very long time. I have been using fountain pens - my favorites - for a while now. For this \"project\" I bought a few \"special\" pens, Pilot Cavaliers (extra fine, fine and medium nibs).\n\nI don't have an explanation why I prefer fountain pens, but they are just so satisfying to write with! You could use different ink with the same pen, refills are cheap, and there's a lot of variety. Anyhow, this is what it looks like (featuring iPhone 13 Pro's macro mode)\n\nHP Sprocket\n\nFinally, I'm using something to make my journal a bit more lively than it would otherwise be. I've got a tiny HP Sprocket printer to feature little pictures along with the text. It looks really nice, and certainly adds some color to the journal.\n\nOverall, these past few month of private journaling were incredible. It's thinking on paper as Leuchtturm1917 put it. And I know, I know, it's no big deal for a lot of people, but for me it's been a very calming, meditation-like experience, that helped alleviate a lot of pent-up anxiety, get my thoughts an feelings in order (and in a very tangible way), got me more mindful and present. I love it!",

            "content_html": "I've ventured into the world of mechanical keyboards a couple of times. The first one was relatively successful: I've got a 60% board with ok keys and had been using it for a couple of years alongside my Apple Magic Keyboard. Probably because of a fairly regular layout and barely noticeable differences between the two keyboards, I didn't really get all the hype around mechanical keyboards. Yes, they are more clicky, a bit nicer to type on due to physical and audible feedback, but that's about it.\n\nThis time around, I went all in. I've been getting tired quickly, my wrists started to ache more and more quickly each day. After a bunch of research and reading, I decided to give mechanical keyboards another shot. Only this time, I decided to go all in: no half-assed keyboards that are barely an improvement, no regular layouts since they proved to be hurting in my hands. \"Only hardcore this time,\" I thought to myself and ordered a Moonlander.\n\nThe Moonlander MK-1 is a keyboard from another world. It's split into two parts: the left part can work independently (which apparently is good for gaming?). It has thumb sections for both hands. It has a set of legs allowing you to tilt it outwards. It has hand rests for comfort. This split design is the main reason why I ordered it: it's radically different from every keyboard I've ever tried, and supposedly it's way easier on your hands when you can position each side of the keyboard independently.\n\nOn the inside, it is fully customizable, and has some really nice features. For example, you could assign a \"hold\" action for any key: when you tap the key, it types a specific character, but if you hold it, it becomes a modifier key (like, type a Z but hold it and it becomes Left CTRL). There are also thee layers you can switch between (by default, it's three, but I think you can have more): I have a regular one, \"num lock\" kind with numbers and symbols, and a media one with media keys and such.\n\nBeing a fully RGB-enabled keyboard, customizing colors of individual keys is really easy. You could also go with a \"theme\" or base your customization on a theme but customize the colors of individual keys.\n\nThe key caps are really nice: they have just enough texture to be a pleasure to touch. I went with Cherry MX Blue switches, and they are satisfyingly clicky, just loud enough to be comfortable yet not too loud.\n\nIt's also pretty important to mention that the keyboard is very, very pretty. My photos don't do it justice, but I hope you get the idea.\n\nWith all this being said, the first few days with this keyboard were beyond frustrating. I couldn't type; all keys are in the wrong places, special characters were hard to find without referring to the keyboard layout cheat sheet.\n\nThere's a special training available for this keyboard and it's really worth it. I went from about 10 words per minute to just over 30 WPM. Still, super slow, but I get better with it every day.\n\nBut perhaps the most important thing is the fact that I can place my hands as I please and fully independently. It's a game changer for me. My hands and wrists are very grateful for this upgrade, and I think I get this whole \"mechanical keyboards\" thing a lot better now.",

            "content_html": "In a normal year, my wife and I would go to 5-10 live concerts. Not only it's something that we love and do, but also something that we can hardly live without. It's not a huge stretch to say that last year sucked in this regard. I recognize that we are very fortunate to have \"live concerts\" as one of the biggest disappointments of 2020.\n\nAnyway, as vaccination rates soared in Washington state in general and in our counties in particular, many restrictions on public events were lifted. Now sitting at about 80% of the population fully vaccinated, it seemed like as good time as any to get back to live music (and other events, eventually).\n\nAs soon as I got a chance, I got tickets to a few concerts; In a way, I over-corrected for the entire year without live music, and got tickets to four shows happening in a span of a month. Two down, two more to go.\n\nHella Mega Tour\n\nGreen Day is one of my all-time favorite bands. \"Wake Me Up When September Ends\" is one of my all-time favorite songs. Fall Out Boy is one of my other all-time favorites. Naturally, they were on a must-see list for a while, but circumstances were never in my favor. Until this September.\n\nHella Mega Tour was supposed to stop by in Seattle in July 2020. Obviously, it was postponed and later rescheduled, and until the very day of the show, I wasn't sure it won't be postponed again (with Delta variant and all).\n\nThe show opened with Weezer set. I'm not a fan, but there are a couple of songs that I like.\n\nFall Out Boy\n\nFall Out Boy is a different story. We've seen them in concert in 2018, and it was awesome. I really like that not only they're good at music but they also stand for what's right.\n\nLast time, I was a little bit surprised by how the band sounded at Key Arena. The sound was a bit weird, somewhat off. I've written it off as a poor seats issue: our seats were to the side of the stage and quite far from it, so it's possible that the sound wasn't off and it were our seats to blame.\n\nI guess I was wrong. The difference is sound between the 2018 concert and this one was so drastic that it's evident: last time the sound was off indeed.\n\nNot sure if this fact is interesting, but when I illegally acquired an iTunes account in 2008 (I was in Russia back then, and iTunes didn't work there), the first album I bought was FOB's \"Infinity on High\". The second one was \"All-American Rejects\", but they are out of scope for this post.\n\nGreen Day\n\nFinally, Green Day. It's safe to say that they are my favorite band right now. I missed their show in Seattle in 2018 and this time I was set on actually making it to see them in concert.\n\nLindsey Stirling\n\nLindsey Stirling holds a special place in my heart. Her music is piercing yet gentle and energetic at the same time. I've seen her perform with Evanescence a couple of years ago, and absolutely loved her sincerity, her ability to be openly vulnerable, yet strong and sweet and wise and positive.\n\nBonus\n\nHere's a 11-minute video with all four performances. Hope it gives you some idea of what it felt like to be there. ",

It's full of history: Kent Prairy was mentioned by the indigenous people as a notible place even before the colonization. And while it has grown quite a bit since then, it still has this small town feel; a feel of a community, history and local culture.\n\nAs many small towns do, Arlington has to walk this fine line between keeping its identity and unavoidable growth brought in part by the fact that it's a part of the Seattle metropolitain area. A huge Amazon distribution center is currently being built just south of Arlington municipal airport; multiple appartment complexes are also in the process of being built. This will change the city, but it feels like the authentic small town feel is something worth preserving.\n\nP.S.

            "content_html": "For those of us in the Unifi ecosystem, Unifi Talk is a cheap and really nice way to add home or home office phone to your network. I'm not 100% sure if a lot of folks still require a home phone, but I thought \"why not\" and went ahead and configured it.\n\nI own Unifi Dream Machine Pro, and someday I'll create an overview of my network, but for now, I'll just focus on the phone configuration. I bought Unifi Touch, a nice-looking traditional phone device. You plug it in, set it up at unifi.ui.com, and you're good to go with a trial number provided by Ubiquity. From this point, you can make and receive phone calls. Easy.\n\nNow, since there's no adventure in this, I decided to add and use my own SIP with Unifi Talk. Now we are talking! Unfortunately, the documentation around this is minimal and lacking in detail. I'm going to try to document my process here.\n\nTwilio\n\nFirst things first. You need a Twilio account. You can sign up for a free trial at twilio.com and buy a phone number (it's $1). With this new phone number in hand, head over to Voice services. There, in \"Manage\" section we'll create a SIP domain. You'll have something like mydomain.sip.twilio.com as your SIP domain. This part is pretty straightforward, and you could just use the default settings except for the IP address and credentials. You'd need to add an external IP address of your UDM (or upstream router), and for credentials, use your phone number as username (with country code, without +, e.g. 12345678910). Leave everything else as-is, save, and let's deal with the SIP BYOC part.\n\nNote: This username === phone number without + is one of the biggest missing pieces in every doc I've found on the subject. Apparently, when there's an inbound call, Unifi Talk will use the username to route the call to the correct phone/user/extension. If this username is not the same as your phone number, you'll get an error along the lines of \"No route exists, aborting\" (you can check this by SSHing into your UDM-Pro, running unifi-os shell, then fs_cli and making an inbound call).\n\nBYOC stands for \"Bring Your Own Carrier\", which is what we are doing here. To make this entire SIP thingy work, we need to add a SIP trunk to Twilio, and instruct Twilio to use this SIP trunk for all incoming and outgoing calls.\n\nHead over to BYOC trunks and create one. We will need a few items here:\n\nTermination SIP Domain (we just created one!)\n\nFrom Domain\n\nOrigination Connection Policy\n\nSet both Termination SIP Domain and From domain to the one we've already created.\n\nGo ahead and create an Origination Connection Policy. This is where we'll tell Twilio to use our SIP trunk for all outgoing calls. Here you will need your external IP address again and add it as sip:1.2.3.4:6767. Leave weight and priority as default, but make sure your sip address points to the port 6767. Save and you're done with Twilio side.\n\nUnifi Talk\n\nNow the fun part. Head over to your Talk application, Settings > System Settings > Add Third-Party SIP Provider. A few things are important here:\n\nCustom Fields\n\nDID Number(s)\n\nACL IP addresses\n\nLet's begin with the Custom Fields. We need to add a few things here:\n\nproxy - this is the SIP domain we created earlier, but with a caveat: instead of mydomain.sip.twilio.com, you'll need to use mydomain.pstn.umatilla.twilio.com - this is a localized SIP trunk domain (umatilla here stands for US-West Oregon and pstn indicates that it's a trunk, roughly speaking)\n\nusername - your phone number without +\n\npassword - your password (from when you've created your SIP domain credentials)\n\nregister - false (this is important!)\n\ntransport - tcp (I'm not sure it actually does anything)\n\ndtmf-type - rfc2833 (this, again, may not do anything)\n\nNext, let's add the phone number. Type it in as a proper E.164 number, e.g. +12345678910 and hit Enter. Done!\n\nFinally, ACL domain ranges. I've added two, specific to my US-West Oregon region: 54.244.51.0/30 and 54.244.51.0/24 (the last number is the CIDR). This is important, because Unifi Talk will only accept calls from these IP addresses. If you're going with a different Twilio region, find the proper ranges for your region here: Twilio's IP addresses for SIP services. Add both Signaling and Media IP ranges.\n\nWe are almost done! Save this new Third-Party SIP Provider, and head back to the System Settings. Toggle \"Create Static Signaling Port\" to true, and make sure that if you have an upstream router, it will properly forward the port 6767 to the port 6767 of your UDM-Pro.\n\nFinal Touch\n\nNow all you need to do is assign your new phone number to a user and their phone device. Head over to the \"Users and Groups\", click \"Edit\", then \"Manage\", and in \"CHANGE PHONE NUMBER\" select your new SIP number. Save, and you are done!",

Floors were in a terrible shape (so much so that we got a sizible seller credit to replace them), and we replaced them ‚Äî one project done, ten more to go. Painting walls, replacing blinds, light switches, sockets, shelves, and a ton of other stuff. We are taking it slowly this time around, but we are making progress.\n\nGardening is fun. I don't have much experience with gardening, but we already had like 3 pounds of strawberries, growing a bunch of carrots, lattice and peas. I screwed up raddish and onions, but I know what to do next.\n\nThe next big project related to the outside is switching from grass lawn to meadow lawns and general landscaping around these meadows. Meadow lawns are amazing: they save water, attract bees, butterflies and birds, they are natural, sustainable, and low maintanance.\n\nAlso, lawns suck:\n\nSpeaking of sustainability. Recently, we had a record-breaking, scorching heat wave.\n\nAll-time temperature records had been broken day after day for 3 days, and not by a degree or two, but by 10+ degrees every time. This is something that will keep happening more and more all over the world; extreme weather and human-led changing climate will make it more and more difficult to sustain human civilization the way it's functioning today. This sucks, and I'm looking into ways we can lead more sustainalbe life here. I monitor electricity we use via Sense, I set our Ecobee thermostat to eco-friendly settings, and set home automations to reduce what resources we use, how, and when we use them. We already replaced our appliences with top-rated Energy Star devices, and we are looking into ways to reduce our energy consumption even more, looking, for example, into solar panels (eventually).\n\nThese views from right above our house are worth preserving, don't you think?\n\nInterestingly enough, here in Washington we use mostly clean renewable energy to generate electricity. This is what my electricity generation breakdown looks like:\n\nSummer Plans\n\nDue to our move, all plans I had for this summer got postponed. I wanted to hike the Loowit Trail again this year, but there's too much stuff to do at home. I hope to mostly settle in by next summer and resume whatever hiking activities I had planned then.\n\nNow that we live in the \"country\", and let's face it, even though Arlington is usually included in \"Seattle Metro area\", it's very much \"country\", there's a lot of stuff to explore.

Working from a lawn chair may sound like a blast but it isn't. My back hurts, and since it's pretty much the only piece of furniture in the house, there aren't many options where else I can sit. The noise isn't exactly helping either, but I manage.\n\nThe floors were in pretty terrible condition, and it looks and feels so much nicer already!\n\nWith this being said, there's so much more to be done here. Paint the walls, replace a couple of windows, replace most interior doors, remodel the kitchen, and don't even get me started on the bathrooms!..\n\n\n\nAll in all, we knew exactly what we were in for with this house, and so far it's been better than expected.\n\nMoving out\n\nWe've moved 10 times and lived in 3 different countries in the past 15 years or so. We are used to moving; we used to move almost every year. Our current place is where we stayed the longest, since 2018. And we were planning on staying here until 2022, but hey, when you get to buy a house, your plans change. We are breaching our lease agreement (and paying extravagant amount of money to do so) and moving out on Tuesday. It's funny how rental advocates always mention that when you rent, it's easier for you to just move; somehow, they always forget about how lease agreements work. In our case, we are basically on the hook for a $2120 lease breaching fee AND we are responsible for paying rent until February 2022 unless a new tenant moves in. On top of that, we cannot live in the apartment even though we will be paying rent. In my personal experience, owning a house gives you significantly more flexibility to just sell it and move.\n\nIt's also worth mentioning that due to work and renovations at the new home, we haven't started packing yet. As of this moment, we have 4 days to pack the entire 2-bedroom + office townhouse. It's going to be stressful 4 days, for sure. Oh, and it's going to be HOT!",

This flaw makes these images invisible for people who access the web using screen readers. So I decided to fix this using AI, computer vision, and serverless functions.\n\nConcept\n\nWhenever I add an image to a blog post, I want this image to be analyzed by an AI. I want the AI to describe an image and append alt text to it if none exists. Since I use Next.js and MDX, and I don't want to spend too much on this operation, I want this analysis to happen only at build time.\n\nTools\n\nThere's a while variety of accessible cloud-base computer vision tools:\n\nGoogle Vision AI\n\nAWS Computer Vision\n\nAzure Cognitive Services\n\nNone of these services is perfect; in my tests, though, Azure came on top as the most accurate when it comes to image descriptions.\n\nSince, again, I'm using Next.js, I don't have to do anything extra to deploy a serverless function that would request image analysis. I can do this right from within Next.js by just adding a file to /pages/api/ folder. The function will be available at https://rosnovsky.us/api/.\n\nThat's it. All we need is a cloud-based computer vision service and a way to deploy a serverless function.\n\nBringing it all together\n\nServerless function\n\nFirst, let's create a serverelss function called pictureDescription. This function will accept image URL, reach out to Azure with this URL, and return alt text it recieves in response from Azure.\n\nThis function will return something like this:\n\nMDX Component\n\nNow, to the MDX Component. This component allows you to use React components right in your MDX. Let's create a funtion that would take image path, width, height and (optionally) alt text. If alt text is supplied, the component will just return Next.js' Image component with existing alt. However, if I forgot to supply alt text, the function will call our API, fetch alt text, and add it to the Image component. If there was an error fetching alt text, an \"I'm sorry\" text will populate alt text.\n\nThat's it. Now, whenever I include ImageWithAlt component in my MDX, it gets an alt text in case there were none.\n\nCheck this out:\n\nThis image had no alt text so Azure generated one for us:\n\nFinal thoughts\n\nThere are a few caveats with this approach. First, obviously, its inaccuracy. While a generic description is better than no description, it certainly lacks accuracy. I hope that with time AI vision and analysis algorithms will get better at it. Second, an image has to be publically available on the web at build time. This requires me to first deploy the site with just images for an upcoming post and then redeploy it when I actually publish the post. Arguably, one could just deploy both images and the post at the same time and then just redeploy it again, but neither is great. Something to think about.\n\nP.S. Always incude alt text with your images!",

            "content_html": "Let me begin by saying that I basically gave up on these weekly updates. I mean, it's been over a month since the latest one. But here's the thing: streaks make us give up stuff. Like, here I am with a broken streak, I can't post the 4th weekly update because the last truly weekly update happened over a months ago. And you know what? Screw this. Just because I failed to keep it up I'm not giving up. I will do my best to post more regularly now :)\n\nHouse\n\nSo, this happened.\n\nOne of the goals for this year that I set for myself was to figure out a way to buy a house in 2021. My job situation is stable, I have saved some money that would be enough to start building down payment on, the market isn't getting any cooler anytime soon, our current landlord got to the point of being obnoxious about their constant nagging, and so on.\n\nIn March we discussed as a family whether or not we can proceed, what the timeline would be, what do we need to do and sacrifice in order to make it happen. We enlisted a real estate agent and got to work.\n\nWithin a few weeks it became painfully evident that any house we remotely like that matches our location preferences is out of our reach. We were set on only making reasonable offers and not participate in bidding wars, and as a result we've got outbid a few times. A few times we decided not to make an offer when it became clear that a particular house would get multiple offers that were likely to go over $50k over asking price.\n\nAbout three weeks into the house hunting, we became pretty discouraged: we could barely afford tiny fixer-uppers in less than desirable places, and we still been only making losing offers. We began expending our search area, but we were not yet ready to compromise on other house parameters. We also were not ready to change our highest price that we were willing to pay.\n\nThen one day in early April I went to view two houses in Arlington. They were for sale as of that day, and they were conveniently located on one street. By the time I got there 40 minutes later, both houses turned from \"for sale\" to \"sale pending\" ‚Äî¬†they got offers while I was driving to view them! By some weird coincidence, there was one other house for sale on that same street that I missed in my search. I let my agent know that we'd consider this other house and asked them to figure out what's what.\n\nThe house ended up being in a decent condition, but required a bunch of interior work. We visited it, walked around, and decided that it's good enough for the price. We made an offer $5K over their asking price, with home inspection and financing contingencies ‚Äî something very rare in Seattle metro area. Our thinking was that if we think this house is not worth more, and we want to fully inspect it and have it properly appraised. We liked the neighborhood a lot, even though Arlington itself is waaay further than what we considered perfect.\n\nIn mid-May, we closed the sale and are getting ready to move in by the end of June. I drive there almost daily after work, doing minor repairs, working with contractors that do major upgrades, meeting neighbors, etc. My wife had painted the garage last week, and overall things are coming together pretty nicely.\n\nFully Vaccinated\n\nWe are now a fully vaccinated household. Even though my son is still waiting for his second shot, for most intents and purposes, we consider our household to be fully vaxxed.\n\nGetting vaccinated in Washington was and remains easy. Vaccine doses are available without an appointment, it takes 15 minutes to get a shot, and it brings you that much closer to getting back to normal. I'm no longer wearing a mask in stores unless I'm speaking with someone at close range, and even then I'd first ask them if they prefer that I wear a mask.\n\nAs of today, 69% of Washington residents are fully vaccinated for COVID-19. We will reach heard immunity threshold of 70% within a couple of days.\n\nWork\n\nWork has been interesting. For starters, my team just won a Hackath0n at work :) With dozens of teams participating, it's pretty wild that our little project got enough votes. The experience itself was not exactly what I wanted it to be, but I'll make it work better next time around.\n\nOur (still) fairly new team is still figuring stuff out. We are setting up a major new program at Auth0, and it's a massive undertaking for the four of us. There's been very little engineering lately, but we are setting up things in a way that would free up a lot of time and resources to do fun stuff soon.\n\nOh, and this week I will launch a live Auth0 Best Practices webinar for customers participating in the program we are building for them. Should be exiting, fun and terrifying :)\n\nUpdating this website\n\nIt's time to admit it: this website is never going to be finished. It's my playground where I try things all the time, rebuild, remake, change and start from scratch. This is exactly what happened this week.\n\nI've been following Lee Robinson for a while and really like how clean and simple his website is. Since Lee's license allowed derivative work, I decided to pull the trigger and rebuild this site based on his setup.\n\nI've updated it to use Typescript, added Algolia-powered full-text search, implemented Auth0 login, and made a few other improvements. It's still mostly Lee's design, look and feel, but I'm determined to make it my own, slowly but surely.\n\nOne of the reasons to draw inspiration from an expert is that not only do you get exposed to the best practices right away, it gives you a chance to see where you can do better than someone you respect. You know, good artists copy, great artists steal. I don't know what decent artists do, but I like to think that copying some, stealing some, and then using either as inspiration for something truly yours makes me a decent artist ;)\n\nComments are coming soon, RSS is available already, podcast pages are in the works, but in the meantime, feel free to subscribe to the newsletter.

Mission accomplished. By the end of week three we signed a contract and we are working on a laundry list of next steps. Long story short, we are moving quite a bit to the north of where we live now ‚Äî we are moving to Arlington.\n\nCoast Salish people from prehistoric times, primarily of the Stillaguamish Tribe, stopped to camp at the forks [of the Stillaguamish River] as they passed up and down the river following the abundant fish runs and otherwise using the river as a primary travel corridor. The Stillaguamish called the place Skabalko.\n\nThe house itself is pretty nice, but requires a lot of interior work. Still, it looks like a nice place to live. My head is occupied by all the house projects, dozens of them. Gotta work on keeping myself sane and going overboard, and it won‚Äôt be easy :))\n\nFamily is in town\n\nSome of the bright spots in immigrant‚Äôs life are those when you get to see your family. This year is special in many respects, and especially because some of my family members will be becoming permanent residents here in the U.S. And while I‚Äôm working on the rest of the plan, step one just got complete: my mom just landed as a resident here! Moreover, today she got her first Covid vaccine shot, so there‚Äôs that. Again, pretty hard to contain my excitement :)\n\nI promise to do better next week, but for now I‚Äôm just going to get back to all this all-consuming stuff. Cheers!",

            "content_html": "Time for another weekly update. Not that my life is so packed with events that it warrants a weekly post about what‚Äôs going on. This week, however, was pretty exciting.\n\nVaccinated, Part 1\n\nJust over a week ago I received an email from Washington Health Department that all of a sudden I‚Äôm eligible to get my COVID vaccine. This is not the kind of situation where you ask ‚Äùwhy‚Äù or ‚Äùare you sure?‚Äù. I immediately went ahead and tried to book an appointment. The only place that still had one was Walgreens in Bremerton. Bremerton is a town around Naval Base Kitsap; it‚Äôs about 50 miles and a ferry ride from home. But if it's literally the last available appointment within 50 miles from home, I'll take it. And so I did. I took a day off work, and all in all, got myself a nice little road trip, 2 cruises (go ahead, convince me that taking a ferry is nothing like a cruise, I dare you!); I had my shot, lunch in a nice restaurant, and a ton of awesome pictures. My next visit to Bremerton for my second shot is scheduled for May 4.\n\nA couple of quick notes about the shot itself:\n\nThe injection site ached for about two days as if someone punched there with their fist. If you don't touch it or make certain moves that engage those specific muscles around the shot, it's easy to forget that it's there.\n\nI felt fatigued and sleepy the next day, this wore off entirely by Day 3.\n\nOther than that, my first shot was entirely uneventful.\n\nHouse hunting\n\nWe are still doing this weird house-hunting thing. As I mentioned before, the market is absolutely wild: buyers are either desperate or have way too much money, and sellers are listing houses with the expectation that they will have dozens of offers and will sell for at least 100K over their initial asking price. Real estate agents are not too interested in \"difficult\" buyers. And we are very much \"difficult\". We don't want to overpay, we have a set budget, a set of reasonable requirements for the house itself and for its location. But being reasonable can't compete with wild Californian money and desperate folks who've been hunting for a house for half a year, had dozens of their offers rejected and will do anything to get a house.\n\nWe are not in a rush, though, and are able to keep hunting. No results so far.\n\nWe are still exploring both buying and building, but chances are that we'll have to make a decision one way or another sometime fairly soon.\n\nHome school?\n\nAnother development that I'm consumed by at the moment is withdrawing our son from school. Since before the pandemic he struggled at school, and this past year only made things worth. And since schooling is not going to change dramatically for him even when we go full in-person, we decided that we'll take matters in our own hands. So far it seems like a very doable and rewarding idea, yet it presents a bunch of challenges that we are not yet sure we know how to approach. One of the difficulties that I've encountered so far is that most homeschooling happens for religious reasons and many materials and advice based on the assumption that parents are looking for some sort of religious angle in education. Not our case, so we are looking around. Still, it's interesting and exciting. I'll keep you posted.\n\nNew therapist\n\nI started seeing a new therapist using Talkspace. I'm lucky enough to have it covered by my health insurance, and it's really convenient since sessions are all video/text in the app. So far it looks like we've connected really well, and that this new therapist is a better match for me. I guess what I'm trying to say is that sometimes it takes a while to actually find a therapist that you just \"click\" with. And I promise you, it's a very nice feeling.\n\nThat's it for today. This next week is going to be even more exciting. Can't wait!",

            "content_html": "Looks like I'm more excited about fiddling with this blog than about actually writing. This is a known phenomenon, and to overcome it, I'm going to post something at least every week.\n\nWork\n\nThis week was all about launching a new program at work. I'm one of a very few members of a new teem on a mission to delight customers who are just starting out with Auth0. While building teams from scratch can be challenging and stressful, it's also extremely rewarding. Just two weeks ago there was nothing, and today we are a functional organization working with customers. There's much to be discovered and figured out, but I think we've build a solid foundation for the team to grow and to reach its full potential.\n\nSpeaking of solid foundations\n\nIt's this time of the year when we contemplate our life choices and consider buying a house. Every other year we go through this, and every time we end up with how impossible it is to buy a reasonably priced home in this north of Seattle area. We've house-hunted for about a month this year, and it's absolutely wild. A decent home gets listed for, say, $550,000, receives 25 offers and gets sold for $675,000 cash. It's entirely ridiculous and totally nuts. So we are taking a step back and considering building a house instead of buying one. So far it looks cheaper, more reasonable, but it's a ton of work and land is pretty scarce, even north of Snohomish. If you have experience with building homes, please let me know in the comments, I've got questions :)\n\nThings to keep after the pandemic subsides\n\nThis past year normalized a lot of good things, and I want to keep some of them after the pandemic subsides.\n\nRemote work. This is a bit controversial. Most people don't have suitable conditions to work from home full-time, and they should be provided an option to work from an office or a nearby co-working space. However, remote work should be an equally acceptable option. Basically, it should be entirely up to employees to choose whether they prefer to work from home or office.\n\nWearing masks. I feel very comfortable wearing a mask. Not only because it provides protection from other people's germs, but also because I feel more secure with my face covered. I want to be able to wear a mask whenever I want, wherever I want, and not being looked down upon.\n\nPhysical distancing. I want to keep \"6 feet apart\" after the pandemic. I don't want to have a person breathing down my neck in line at the grocery store. I don't want to sit in a packed restaurant bumping elbows with other people. I want every place that's been functioning at 50% capacity to keep it this way. I understand that it's not going to happen for economic reasons, but one can dream...\n\nOnline-first everything. Every store and service needs to have a fully-functional e-commerce website. I want to keep the ability to book everything online, buy stuff online, order services online. Everything that can be feasibly delivered online or to my door, should be.\n\nEverything by appointment. I want to keep booking appointments for everything. Picking up something from a store? I want to keep booking the exact time I'm going to come for this pickup and avoid waiting in line. DMV? I want to book my spot, come at the reserved time, and be on my way.\n\nNormalize government footing healthcare bills. Now that it's clear that Universal healthcare is inevitable, before it happens, I want to normalize government footing healthcare bills for critical services: vaccinations, life-saving treatment, emergency service and more. It's almost we are about to join developed nations in this regard, then why wait?\n\nNormalize sick leave. People should never come to work, physically or remotely, when they feel sick. They should never have to choose between taking care of their health and being paid. Sick people should be able to just take care of their health and come back to work when they feel better without losing their income.\n\nI bet there are other things that I forgot about. Have your favorite things to keep after the pandemic? Leave a comment!",

Confusion, uncertainty, adaptation to the new work paradigm, burnout, finding my routine, and just generally trying to fit this square \"2020\" peg into... well, into anything, really.\n\nIt's been a wild ride. As wild as it gets. Looking back to our occasional lunches (I wish we had had more of them!), our cozy corner of the office, light-hearted chats, massive all hands meetings... I miss it. A lot.\n\n\n\nThe shift towards all-remote work wasn't particularly difficult: I mean, we all have some remote work experience, and I have years and years of it. And we are lucky that we were able to work through the entire 2020 without skipping a bit. It took its toll, sure, and it was never easy mentally, but overall it could be much worse.\n\nWe had our U++ event last summer (not a replacement for a company offsite in Mexico, but still), Security++, Auth0 Unite, incidents, fantastic new features, painful teachable moments, and a lot of fun together yet apart.\n\nLast year I posted some of my observation made on the job, and in all honesty, there's not much to add. Processes are critically important, keeping promises is key, working together we are unstoppable. There's no such thing as \"difficult customers\", and if you know something or learned something ‚Äî share with the group! Aside from these remarks, I stand by my year-old observations.\n\nThis Monday marks a huge leap for me. On Monday I start my new role as Onboarding Engineer.

            "content_html": "It's been a journey. Never before I was able to stick with the website I've developed for myself for so long :)\n\nIn Part 2 of this series, I outlined some new stuff that I changes since I published Part 1. Since then, I've posted a general comments overview (it's pretty cool), and described how I go around generating social images for my blog posts.\n\nToday, I want to touch a little bit on some of the moving parts that are involved. It's still a more or less general overview. Eventually, I'll get to posting all the technical bits as well.\n\nCovid Component\n\nAt the top of the home page, there's a Covid component. It's a neat little thing that fetches the latest data from CovidTracking Project and presents it in three nice cards. Early on I decided that I'm going to have this at the top of the page for the remainder of the pandemic. Since CovidTracking is winding down its data collection in March, I'd need to switch to a different source. Hopefully, sometime soon I'd switch to tracking the recovery and will remove this component entirely once we are on track to recovery.\n\nThis component uses SWR to update data and a bunch of tricks to display how it has changed since the day before. Check it out!\n\nInfinite Scroll\n\nThis one is more or less standard. If you scroll to the bottom of the home page, a set of new posts will be loaded and show up. This is made so that the home page itself loads faster, while additional posts are loaded lazily on-demand. This one is using `request` to fetch the next set of posts from Sanity's GraphQL endpoint, nothing fancy, but I'm still pretty proud of it. Check it out.\n\nGraphQL vs GROQ\n\nAn arbitrary decision that I'm still contemplating. Sanity offers GROQ as its main query language. It's a bit unusual and takes some time to wrap one's head around, and I'm almost there, I guess. But so far I'm using familiar GraphQL to fetch data. This approach introduces some unexpected challenges. For example, when fetching a blog post via GraphQL, you get the main image as a reference to an actual document. With GROQ you could request this image object as well, but with GraphQL it's quite tricky and a bit convoluted. This fact is keeping me on track to switching to GROQ eventually.\n\nPerfect is the enemy of good\n\nIt's been a constant battle between me wanting to push something to prod here and me being cautious and holding back because things are not perfect yet, not ready for prime time, so to speak.\n\nThe Covid component is used to break with unusual data or upon some unexpected schema changes on the CovidTracking Project side. I think, I fixed most of it.\n\nInfinite scroll used to break unexpectedly. Again, appears to be fixed now.\n\nComments are an unfinished mess that actually works pretty well, although it does lack a ton of features.\n\nAll of these things are not perfect. In fact, nothing about this site is perfect. However, I decided to go ahead and push it anyway. Moreover, I push most updates almost immediately to production. So most of the time you're seeing the very latest code running the site.\n\nAt first, I really struggled with this. I'd scrap the entire project and start over because of how imperfect it was getting. I'd delete entire components to start over because of this same reason: they weren't good enough. It cost me months of lost time. What I learned, though, is that\n\nnobody cares how imperfect my blog is\n\nexposing it to the world helps me move faster given your feedback\n\nnothing is perfect :)\n\nIf I chose to make things perfect first and then push them, this site wouldn't go live, probably, ever. So here it is, imperfect, live, and available to you to criticize and comment on. Did I mention that comments are a reliably working mess? ;)",

            "content_html": "It‚Äôs safe to say that for the first time in a long time, I actually finished something. Well, not 100% finished, but got this _something _into a usable state.\n\nIn my previous post, I outlined some of the plans for this blog. And while Social Images ‚Äî one of the features I planned early on ‚Äî was pretty easy to implement, this one was much more challenging.\n\nStatic Sites\n\nThis particular site is powered by Next.js 10, a fantastic framework powering millions of static websites. It‚Äôs really easy to build a static blog with Next.js, hook it up to Sanity.io, and deploy it to Vercel. Next.js is smart enough to offer both static pages, dynamic pages, and a thing they call Incremental Static Generation. With out-of-the box serverless functions integration with Vercel, truly the sky is the limit.\n\nThe biggest challenge, though, comes when you realize that your site is built once, then deployed and remains what it was at build time until you re-build and re-deploy It.\n\nClearly, some pages and features absolutely require dynamically generated pages. Take user profiles, for example, or dashboards, you get the idea. Next.js allows you to mix and match static and dynamic content, but dynamic pages do not get some of major benefits of pre-generated pages.\n\nAnd here we come to the comment sections of blogs. There‚Äôs a fair number of folks who detest blog comments, and I understand the sentiment. I‚Äôm not sure I‚Äôm a fan either, but here I am, learning stuff while building a comment section for my blog ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è\n\nComments\n\nComments are not dynamic per se. They are static when already posted. Yet, when someone posts a comment things get more complicated. A newly posted comment could trigger an entire site rebuild, or, in case of Next.js, trigger an incremental rebuild of a specific page (I‚Äôll get to this in a moment). So this solves the issue, right? Someone posts a comment, Next.js rebuilds the page, everybody‚Äôs happy? Not exactly. Users would have to refresh the page to see their new comment: the page had been rebuilt in the background, yes, but to get this newly built page, you‚Äôd have to hit refresh. Not ideal.\n\nDynamic Comments on Static Sites\n\nWell, there‚Äôs a way around this limitation as well. stale-while-revalidate to the rescue! With a nice package from Vercel team called SWR you can do all sorts of magic. And here it all comes together:\n\nA bunch of static blog posts gets generated at build time and deployed to a static hosting\n\nSomeone wants to leave a comment to a specific blog post\n\nThey visit the page and post their comment\n\nNext.js triggered incremental rebuild of this specific blog post page\n\nSWR forces to refresh the content of the page in the background\n\nA happy user sees their comment magically appear almost immediately after posting, without a page reload!\n\nNow, it sounds pretty simple and straightforward, and I promise you it is! However, there‚Äôs so much more that goes into posting comments.\n\nWhere do you store these comments?\n\nHow do you authenticate visitors?\n\nBelieve it or not, but I spent probably 80% of the time on these two items. I ended up storing comments in MongoDB and authenticate users with Okta Firebase Auth0. Let me gather my thoughts and walk you through the specifics in the next post.\n\nFeel free to leave a comment below :) Please keep in mind that it‚Äôs still very much work in progress: some obvious things don‚Äôt work as expected, others are half-baked, and the entire thing is fairly easy to break.

            "content_html": "Since my previous post about rebuilding this site, I‚Äôve made enough progress to actually launch the site. You‚Äôre looking at it right now :)\n\nStack\n\nInitially, I planned on using Gatsby, and I in fact built the entire site with Gatsby at its heart. But where‚Äôs fun in that?\n\nNext.js with TypeScript\n\nWhile I was finishing the site with Gatsby, Next.js 10 came out, and I had to try it. It's such an impressive framework, there was no way I won't give it a shot. It took me a few hours to completely replace Gatsby with Next.js, and there's so much I love about Next! Just some of them are:\n\nStatic and dynamic generation\n\nChoose your own data fetching (GROQ, GraphQL, plain fetch, you name it!)\n\nDynamic module imports \n\nAwesome code-splitting\n\nBy-default performance and web-vitals optimization\n\nBuilt-in image optimization\n\nBuilt-in serverless functions (especially, when deployed to Vercel)\n\nDeveloper experience is also pretty nice. With Next's amazing flexibility and ease of use, I was able to rewrite major chunks of code by trying different approaches, and it not only was a breeze, but it also allowed me to try multiple things within just a couple of hours. All told, I'm a fan. I wish Svelte Kit gets to the same level of maturity sometime really soon ‚Äî¬†for now, Next.js is the next best thing.\n\nTailwind 2\n\nI'm a huge fan of the utility-first approach offered by Tailwind. It takes a minute to get a hang of it, but when you get it, you get it. It's fantastically easy to style elements, move them around, and make things as responsive or rigid as you want. It's a truly great tool for efficient and productive web styling. While I've been working on the rewrite, Tailwind upgraded from version 1.x to 2.0, and migration was a breeze.\n\nSanity\n\nI've selected Sanity.io as a CMS for my website. Some of the reasons for this decision were, in no particular order:\n\nFantastic flexibility in modeling data\n\nDeveloper-first DNA\n\nFull out-of-the-box GraphQL support\n\nGreat community and awesome documentation\n\nData portability: if Sanity doesn't work out for me, I can easily take all my data and move it wherever\n\nSo far, I love what I've built with Sanity, and I will showcase my setup in a separate post. I got so thrilled with this CMS that I've built a plugin for it: Autocomplete Tags. I use it in every project now :)\n\nCloudinary\n\nThe last technology I want to mention is Cloudinary. Honestly, it was an afterthought to the large extent, and a lot needs to be done before I can claim in earnest that I'm using it. So far, all it does is \"generate\" social cover images for my posts. Try sharing this post on Facebook or Twitter to see what I mean. I will write another post about this bit as soon as I get to reworking social images.\n\nDeployment\n\nOriginally, I was planning on deploying this site to Netlify. I love Netlify, it's a great place to host a JAM website. However, at the time I moved from Gatsby to Next.js, Netlify was not too friendly to certain aspects of Next's powers. And given that Next.js is created by the same folks who run Vercel, I naturally just moved to Vercel. As a result, not only did I cut build and deployment time in half, but I also have access to \"real-time\" web vitals/lighthouse analytics ‚Äî it's built into both Vercel and Next.js.\n\nWhat‚Äôs next?\n\nThis year, I plan to make some major improvements.\n\nImprove progressive loading for images. Now they are lazy-loaded, which is good, but I'm looking to improve the experience with progressive loading. I've implemented this and had to remove it due to its wonkiness.\n\nEmail subscription. With RSS effectively dead, email subscription will be the main avenue for delivering updates along with posting to social media. Low effort solution, shouldn't take long to implement.\n\nRelated posts. Another low-effort solution. With tags attached to every post, it's fairly easy to introduce relevant related posts at the bottom of every post.\n\nImprove design. So far, I like the boldness of it, but there are things that I'd like to improve and so far I don't really know how to do it ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è\n\nAI/ML generated image captions. Every image posted on the website will have a caption and/or alt text generated by Microsoft's Computer Vision\n\nSearch with Algolia or vanilla JS. Not sure yet what route I want to go here. Vanilla JS search is easy to implement and could be as robust as I want it to be, but Algolia offers so much more than just search. I'm torn :)\n\nLinkCards with metascrapper. Right now, I'm low-key using microlink.io and their React SDK to generate embedded cards for certain links. I don't like this approach for a variety of reasons, the main of them being it's a paid 3rd-party service. So I will build my own LinkCard component, with blackjack and hookers.\n\nComments. Not sure how critical these are, but definitely worth exploring. The main difficulty here is the static re-generation of post pages when new comments are posted. Next's incremental static generation should really help with this a lot.\n\nMembership with Auth0. Powered by Auth0, I will offer some sort of extra content or functionality to members.\n\nSubscription with Stripe. Mostly for the sake of learning how to do this with a JAM site. \n\nFinally, a variety of post types: book reviews, podcast episodes (yep, the podcast is returning!), hike reports, and so on.\n\nStay tuned for more. One of my goals this year is to blog much, much more. And I'm determined to stick with this goal üí™",

            "content_html": "was planning to add social images to my posts for a long time, and when I launched this version of the website, I didn't really put any effort into making this happen. As soon as I shared the launch post, I discovered that many things were broken with social images, from errors in URL encoding to a wrong background image on each social image.\n\nAs you can see, the background here belongs to a different post, although this particular card doesn't have any other obvious issues. In any case, this is something I wanted these cards to actually look like.\n\nIt's not perfect, but here's what's going on this card:\n\nThere's a blurred cover image that belongs to this particular post in the background\n\nA card with post info is overlayed on top of this background image\n\nCorrect category and post date\n\nThere's a short summary of what the post is about\n\nThere are different approaches one could take here, from passing parameters of an image directly to a service like Cloudinary to generating a screenshot. Without going into obscure details, here's how I made this happen.\n\nStep One: Generate a card\n\nI created a page, that generates a webpage with all the data I pass to it: title, publication date, category, etc.\n\nHere's an example: this link leads to the page that builds the social card.\n\nAll this is is an HTML page dynamically generated based on passed parameters. It's this basic but opens a ton of flexibility. This page is just one of my other pages on this website.\n\nStep Two: Capture a screenshot\n\nNow we need to turn this page into an image. I use a serverless function to do this. This function accepts required parameters, passes them to the social card page, takes and returns a screenshot. There are different ways of doing this, and I opted for a headless Chrome. I've written a function that loads the page generated in the previous step and takes a screenshot of a viewport of the size I like (780x420 in my case). Again, without going into obscure details, here's what it looks like:\n\nDepending on whether I'm developing or this runs in production, this function takes a URL to the card page, launches headless Chrome, takes a screenshot, and returns a base64-encoded image.\n\nStep Three: upload image to Cloudinary (or anywhere, really)\n\nThis is the easiest and the most arbitrary step. I wanted to use Cloudinary in some way to learn more about it, and although here I only use it as image hosting, I was able to poke around it for a bit. Anyway, in this step, we take the image we got in the previous step and just upload it to Cloudinary:\n\n\n\nStep Four: return something\n\nAgain, there are different options here: you could return a permanent redirect with HTTP 308 Permanent Redirect status, or just respond with an OK and move on. The difference is in the way you incorporate the resulting image URL into your HTML. Some might add the URL of the serverless function that captures and uploads a screenshot right inside of a <meta> tag: in this case, permanent redirect makes sense. As soon as someone requests the page, they will attempt to read the meta tag URL and receive the uploaded image URL in response, permanently. However, in my experiments, it looks like sometimes the serverless function runs for some time (3-5 seconds) and meta scrappers just default to not having any image instead of waiting for the image URL. What I'm doing is a bit different: I'm \"fetching\" this serverless function in useEffect of the post's page and \"hardcode\" the resulting URL in the meta tag (since I know upfront what the URL would be, it's easy to know beforehand what URL to use for every post ‚Äî¬†it always look like this: https://.../social-images/{POST TITLE}.png)\n\nUPDATE: Well, apparently, it's more performant to add the URL to the serverless function directly to the meta tag after all. Sorry about the confusion :)\n\nConsiderations\n\nThere are some checks and considerations in place. First, the function checks if the image already exists, and if so, it returns it's URL right away. Next, there are default values in place: in case the function doesn't receive a title or post date, it would use placeholders to still produce an image. Now, it takes up to 5 seconds for the image to be generated for the first time; if you attempt to share the post immediately after publishing without visiting it first, scrappers may not wait until the image is generated and use a default image or no image instead. These are some of the things to keep in mind and improve down the road.",

            "content_html": "There's no need to reiterate that 2020 was absolutely terribly awful in every way possible. Dead relatives, friends, and acquaintances, sick loved ones, ruined lives, and futures altered forever. In whatever scheme of things you look at 2020, it was abysmally horrible. Yet humans do human things: we adapt, regroup, process, and move on. And we have hope. Hope that 2021 will be better. That we will persevere, and come out of this whole mess stronger and more resilient, individually and as species. Today, though, I want to take a moment and take a look back at _my_ 2020.\n\n\nAll in all, it was not too terrible, albeit terrible nonetheless.\n\nIt was my first full year at Auth0 ‚Äî I joined the company in December 2019 and started really contributing in 2020. I enjoyed commuting to our office in Bellevue and hang out with my colleagues. I've been learning, in scientific terms, a _shitload_ of stuff, and it was so very cool. And overall, I got so much better at everything I do!\n\nIn late February, my son Vlad had terrible viral bronchitis, which I'm almost certain was in fact COVID. Both my wife and I got mildly sick afterward, and since COVID testing and reliable information were non-existent, we'll never know for sure. In early March, Vlad's school had a case and was shut down. It hasn't reopened since.\n\nAuth0 offices closed in mid-March and there's no concrete plan to reopen them soon. They are ready for us to come back when it's safe: the Bellevue team outfitted it with all possible safety measures. I'm not coming back until everyone in my household gets a vaccine; most people I know are in the same boat. Our company offsite in Mexico was canceled, what a bummer.\n\nIt's safe to say that because of where I work, I'm much, much better off than many. I can work from home and Auth0 paid for my home office equipment. I can take as much time off work as I need, at any moment, no questions asked (especially, if it's related to COVID). And for this I'm grateful.\n\nIn March I finished my second tattoo. It's a Phoenix, a mythical bird that rises from the ashes over and over. This tattoo reminds me of all the difficulties I'd overcome over the years and that no matter what happens next, I will pull through.\n\nI hiked a lot this summer. I even hiked around Mt. Loowit (St. Helens) and returned home in one piece. I also met a black bear in the wild and lived to tell the story.\n\nNever in my life was I as productive as in 2020. Don't get me wrong, the first few months were brutal, distracting, and lonely but eventually, I got it.\n\n\nI worked so much and with such efficiency, I still can't believe it. And it all paid off already or will pay off in immediate future.\n\nThis last bit made possible in part thanks to my psychiatrist: this year I was diagnosed with ADHD and bipolar depression and got proper treatment. There's still a long road ahead, but it's a start.\n\nWe were more together this year.\n\nEven when we were thousands of miles apart:\n\n\nAnd of course, these things happened. Now I know what tear gas smells like, and why defunding the police is the only way of fixing it.\n\nI also realized that I don't want to have people in my life, who do not consider human rights above all else. My social circle shrank considerably and I regret nothing.\n\n\nMy car got scratched a bit:\n\nFor the first time, I voted in the US elections.\n\nFinally, some good news this year:\n\n\nAll in all, Fuck 2020, fuck you very-very much.\n\nHere's to 2021!",

I realize that‚Äôs a fairly low-effort topic, but a) you gotta start somewhere, b) Low effort `!==` low quality, and c) I really do save hours of my life every month with these tools. Since you may also find some value in this, I decided to make a quick blog post about these tools.\n\nWorld Clock\n\nFor any person who deals with multiple time zones, knowing what time is where now, and more importantly _not_ now, is always a challenge. Our Americas Developer Support team is spread across 3 time zones, our global support team works in 10 time zones and covers the entire globe, my Auth0 colleagues work from, perhaps, all time zones, as do our customer.\n\nAvailable in Setapp\n\nTextExpander\n\nIt took me over a decade to get to the point where I‚Äôm comfortable using TextExpander. Not because it‚Äôs difficult to use but because I haven‚Äôt had a good use case for it before. These days as a Developer Support Engineer, I type a lot, and a lot of the stuff I type is quite repetitive. Since I started using TextExpander, it saved me about 5 hours of typing things that I would type anyway. It‚Äôs quite simple: when you type a snippet, say, `zauth0` or `zfig`, TextExpander turns these tiny words into phrases and sentences (`zauth0` turns into my full signature, with email, title and such, and `zfig` turns into ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs figure it out.‚Äù When you type something a lot, TextExpander would create a new snippet for you and remind you to use every now and again until you incorporate it into your typing. At this time, I‚Äôve got around 50 snippets, and I can‚Äôt be happier not to have to type the same things over and over again.\n\nPaw\n\nPaw is a native Mac application for inspecting and making HTTP requests. If you are familiar with Postman, Paw is basically the same but native to the Mac (unlike Postman, which is an Electron app). Paw is gorgeous, perfectly tailored to the system, works with all system shortcuts and native extensions, and it could be as powerful as you need it to be. Yet in the true spirit of native Mac applications, it‚Äôs not bloated with obscure features, bells, and whistles. It‚Äôs clean, beautiful, and, powerful ‚Äî exactly the way we like our day-to-day tools to be.\n\nAvailable in Setapp\n\nCleanShotX\n\nThere are dozens if not hundreds of apps one could use to take and share screenshots. Hell, you could take screenshots with a simple shortcut built into macOS, no applications needed! Yet with CleanShotX, you could take a screenshot or make a screencast using the same system-wide shortcuts you‚Äôd normally use, edit the image (highlight something, blur private information, add a text comment, arrows, you name it), and share it with just another click (or a ‚åò-v). Those who remember Skitch killed by Evernote would absolutely love this one!\n\nAvailable in Setapp\n\nPaste\n\nFinally, Paste. Again, there are a bunch of similar apps and a bunch of apps that have similar features (think Alfred or Quicksilver), but Paste made it really natural for me to never think about my copy-paste buffer ever again. If I ever copied something ‚Äî anything ‚Äî an image, a secret, and app id, whatever it is, I‚Äôll be able to find it and paste it again with a natural keyboard shortcut. Paste makes it easy to search whatever you copied in the past and even create collections of frequently pasted things. Super easy to use, and tremendously helpful every day.\n\nAvailable in Setapp\n",

Year after year, I try different tech stacks, design approaches, and platforms, and this time around I decided to do something differently.\n\nWhy Rebuild\n\nMy primary goal is to learn new tech and build a nice site. Over the years, I've collected an endless list of things I want to implement on my personal site, but for the longest time I tried to find an existing product I can use and that meets my requirements.\n\nUnfortunately, building on top of my existing blog is not really viable (or flexible enough). At this moment, my main site runs on Ghost hosted on Digital Ocean. Even though Ghost has a nice CMS interface and somewhat works with static frontends, It's not flexible enough for what I want to do. As a result, I'm doing a full rebuild, from scratch.\n\nWhy Share\n\nLast year I tried live coding on Twitch, and it worked out pretty well. I got some viewers and even subscribers, but more importantly, I worked out my imposter paralysis. Sharing my coding sessions live with an unknown group of people made me realize that I know enough to share my knowledge and make it helpful to others. It's also fun, I must add ;)\n\nThis time, with a throve of new experience and new knowledge I want to share more and more regularly. I will build individual components, design and re-design the site, and poke around many things I know literally nothing about at this moment. Fun, right?!\n\nThe Plan\n\nIt's fair to say that I don't have a solid plan to follow. I do track some of the ideas on GitHub, but it's very much a work in progress. But generally, the plan is to start with what I've built so far and proceed until I'm happy with the results. I don't think it's the kind of work that has an end, but I'm going to build and improve a bunch of things, from the look and feel to the personal library and CMS plugins along the way; we'll add comments to the blog posts, contact forms, and a bunch of serverless functions. I plan to live stream whenever I can with the goal of streaming whenever I work on this project.\n\nProgress\n\nSo far I've bootstrapped a Gatsby website with [Sanity](https://sanity.io) as a CMS hosted on [Netlify](https://netlify.com). Santy actually warrants a whole separate blog post: I really dig it and enjoy it enough to build a plugin :) I use Tailwind for styling, Auth0 for identity, and user management, and will be using Mux for live streaming on the website and Stripe for subscriptions and such. Quite a few things to learn and implement!\n\nNext Steps\n\nSubscribe to my Twitch or Youtube and check back every now and again. Submit your bug report to Github, and add your ideas to the project.

This is a long one, so bear with me. Or don't.\n\nThe idea to hike the Loowit Trail came to me way back, probably, around 2013, when my family and I visited Johnston Ridge Observatory.\n\nI learned that there was a hiking trail right at the bottom of the breached side of the volcano, and I had this trail in mind ever since.\n\nMt. Loowit (St. Helens)\n\nThroughout this post, sometimes I will refer to Mt. St. Helens by its native name, Loowit (Lawetlat'la, Loowit or Louwala-Clough to be precise). For centuries, the mountain had its name, but colonizers in their infinite arrogance decided to give it a new name. In 1792 Commander George Vancouver named this landmark after his friend British diplomat Alleyne Fitzherbert, 1st Baron St Helens.\n\nMt. Loowit is the youngest volcano in the Cascades. It is located on the indigenous lands of Cowlitz and Klickitat native people (now part of Yakama Nation). The slopes of the mountain above the treeline are a Traditional Cultural Property of Cowlitz and Yakama tribal groups. For thousands of years, the mountain has been a central place in the culture and mythology of the tribes, where resources were gathered and young people were sent to test themselves.\n\nAlthough I only ventured above the \"treeline\" once or twice along the Loowit trail, I can clearly see why this incredible place is at the center of indigenous cultures. I encourage you to take a look at some of the legends collected and passed down through generations.\n\nMay 18, 1980\n\nPrior to May 18, 1980, Mt. St. Helens was a beautiful cone-shaped peak, sometimes referred to as Mt. Fuji of the Pacific Northwest. It all changed early on that day. There are a few fantastic documentaries about the infamous eruption and the subsequent largest landslide in recorded history.\n\nEver since the eruption, Mt. St. Helens fascinated scientists, hikers, photographers, writers and became a preserved natural treasure.\n\nThe trail\n\nOf course, there's a hiking trail around the volcano, it's PNW, what did you expect?! :)\n\nThe Loowit Trail circles the mountain at about 4400 ft of elevation, sometimes dipping as low as 2900 ft and soaring to over 4800 ft. Its length depends a lot on the approach, but generally, it's considered to be between 30 and 35 miles, with a total elevation gain of around 9000 ft.\n\nThe trail is considered to be Difficult to Expert level, and for a good reason: it throws every possible terrain and challenge at you, all the time! I don't know what I was thinking when I decided that I should totally hike it: I'm not in great physical shape and my backpacking experience prior to this hike was limited to 2-nighters. Anyway, I was set on hiking it during my time off, and when I'm set on an adventure, nothing can stop me (except for a broken leg, evidently)\n\nPreparation\n\nFor this hike, I went all-in on ultralight gear. Ultralight tent, ultralight quilt, ultralight sleeping pad, ultralight backpack, the list goes on. I trimmed my base weight to about 12 pounds, which is quite fascinating if you ask me. I also had 2 65 oz bottles for water and another 2-liter water bag.\n\nSo on the gear front, I was well-prepared and ready to go. Some things that I've taken with me I hadn't used a lot or even at all, but those were minor and inconsequential.\n\nI was not as prepared physically as I thought I was but will get to it.\n\nOn Sunday, I arrived at Climbers Bivouac, set up my tent, quickly drove to Portland to pay my respects to the folks protesting in front of the Injustice Center. I got back to the camp after dark and went straight to sleep. Tomorrow was going to be a long day.\n\nDay one\n\nI got up pretty late ‚Äî most climbers were long gone. The weather was perfect for me: low overcast, fairly chilly, and quiet.\n\nThe first segment of the hike is the approach to the Loowit Trail. To get to the trail from the camp, you need to hike up Ptarmigan trail for about two miles and something like 700 ft of elevation, until you hit an intersection with Loowit trail. There, I took a right turn and proceeded counter-clockwise.\n\nThe trail was fairly light for the first few miles. It mostly went downhill, and the climbing segments were fairly light. The views were already quite impressive, especially if you consider that there's a looming volcano behind the clouds!\n\nThis first part of the trail, approximately between Climbers to Windy Pass has quite a few water sources, and it gave me a false impression that water is not going to be a problem. Yes, this water was silty and muddy, but it's water so who cares, right?!\n\nI topped up my water containers here at the Chocolate falls and hit my first challenging segment: Worm Flows. This is basically a giant lava boulder field you need to cross. The trail is non-existent, and you hop from boulder to boulder navigating to the next white stake in the distance.\n\nThe day was going towards sunset at this point, so I pushed forward to hit my Day One target (about 7 miles) and set up camp for the night before dark.\n\nAnd there you have it. Day one was in the books, I felt pretty good about my progress and the fact that I hit my first target. There were some wild animals sniffing around the tent all night, but nothing interesting happened, and I didn't find any interesting footprints in the morning.\n\nDay two\n\nWhen you backpack for days, at some point it's easy to sync with the sun. You wake up around sunrise and normally settle down for the night right after sunset. At least that's my experience.\n\nDay two began early: I had about 6-8 miles to hike through pretty rugged terrain and under full sun and clear skies. My goal was to push all the way to Windy Pass ‚Äî the edge of the Restricted zone in front of the Breach ‚Äî¬†the part of the mountain that got destroyed during the eruption.\n\nAs mentioned before, the terrain on this stretch of the trail is pretty rough. Looking back, it's not that rough, especially compared to some later segments.\n\nThe views were breathtaking. I paused every now and again just to stare in the distance, taking it in as much as I can.\n\nRugged boulder fields turned into a huge stretch of huckleberry fields. Quite literally, you're making your way on a narrow trail slicing an endless huckleberry field! The berries were ripe, juicy and so very tasty!\n\nI was getting pretty tired. All these uphills, boulders, lack of shade began to take tall. I refilled my water at Muddy River, and realized that I'm probably not going to make it to my target area before sunset.\n\nI pushed forward for as long as I could. The problem was that since I was tired, hot, and pushing, I drank a lot of water. And I was running out fairly quickly. I decided that I'll go until I find a water source and will break camp somewhere nearby.\n\nI use Gaia GPS as my primary navigation app, and I truly love it. Aside from providing 100s of map layers (including cell coverage, air quality, and more), it has some unique data I relied on in this trip: campsites.\n\nI was lucky enough to chat with a fellow hiker who let me know that the creek that looks to be running by the campsite here, in fact, changed and is now running quite a bit to the West. This spot became my new goal for the day.\n\nI arrived at the campsite right before sunset, set up a tent, enjoyed the view for a bit, and went to sleep.\n\nDay three\n\nWhen this is what you wake up to, the day just can't be bad!\n\nI think now is a good time to mention a few things that very clearly went wrong by this point:\n\nI was running out of water much faster than I could find water sources.\n\nI somehow punctured my inflatable sleeping pad and despite my repair efforts, it was deflating almost completely within 1-2 hours. My back wasn't happy about this, and sleep quality got pretty low.\n\nThe food I brought with me was either dehydrated or too sweet for me to hold. By this point in time, I haven't eaten much in the past 2 days, yet it didn't bother me yet\n\nI was running ~3 miles behind schedule. With a Restricted Zone looming ahead ‚Äî you must cross it's ~9 miles in one go, no camping allowed ‚Äî I will have to cover these 3 miles and 9 miles of the Restricted zone today in order to camp legally. 12 miles is ok on easier trails, but by this time I realized that 12 miles in one day on this trail is probably beyond my abilities.\n\nWith all this in mind, I embarked on this most exciting part of the trail ‚Äî the one that crosses the Breach and pumice fields left in front of the mountain by the 1980 blast and subsequent landslide.\n\nThe first few miles from my camp to Windy Pass were a breeze. The mostly flat prairie-like trail all the way to the pass. I enjoyed my walk a lot, and was wondering for a while whether I could've made it the day before. I probably could have pushed for a few more miles, break camp after dark beside the Windy Pass and shave these extra miles off of my Restricted Zone day.\n\nGoing over the pass look intimidating at first, but was in fact fairly easy. The trail there goes along the hillside and is not very stable and has a few really sketchy spots, but overall it was easier than I expected.\n\nThe following few miles go over the side of the mountain slowly introducing the Breach ‚Äî the side of the volcano destroyed by the blast in 1980. For me, this was the most exciting part of the journey. Walking on top of many feet of fairly new volcanic ash, seeing the destruction side of the volcano myself, and traversing many canyons, streams, and erosion areas while seeing the mountain at a very unusual angle.\n\nIt's been 40+ years since the eruption, yet the mountain is still settling in. Constant rock fall noise, steam, and ash floating in the air, ever-changing streams and riverbeds ‚Äî it will likely take hundreds of years for all this stuff to calm down. Geologically speaking, 40 years is nothing, a blink of an eye, so from the volcano's perspective, it just erupted moments ago and the process of healing hasn't even started yet. Biologically, though, even in the blast zone, life is everywhere. From grass and weeds to all sorts of shrubs and sub-alpine flowers and native trees, it's all here. Chipmunks, coyotes, birds of every color, elk, and deer, it's all here.\n\nTo say that this is an active and dangerous volcano would be an understatement. In the past 30 days, there were close to a dozen earthquakes under Mt St Helens, and every year there periods of swarm earthquakes: dozens of magnitude 1-3 shakes that happen within days and weeks. Something is still going on down there, and at any point, the mountain can start erupting again (the same way it happened twice in 2006 and then in 2008).\n\nThis is the heart of the blast zone. Behind me is the gaping wound left by the eruption. You can't hear rocks falling, but you can see clouds of ash they send up in the air.\n\nBy this point, I'm exhausted. A few miles back, I hit an oasis: a little stream, ice-cold and absolutely clear, surrounded by some trees and bushes. I refilled all my water containers, relaxed in the shade for a bit, and pushed forward through the blast zone.\n\nMy goal for the day was to get to the South Fork Toutle River ‚Äî¬†the next water source and the place where the restricted zone ends and camping is allowed again.\n\nBy the time I left the breach area, I was at the end of my rope: I was tired, I practically ran out of water, and I still had about 4 miles ahead of me to get to Toutle River. There was no way I'd make it there, and it was time to admit it and plan accordingly.\n\nI decided to push as far as I humanly can, again. With canyons turning deeper and deeper, and hiking mostly uphill at this point, this \"as far as humanly possible\" turned out to be about 2 miles or so. I found a spot (still in the restricted area) and pitched my tent ‚Äî¬†there was no way I'd cross this canyon today. I fell asleep almost immediately.\n\nBy this time, I had exactly two sips of water left and 2 miles to hike up and down to the next water source. I was in trouble.\n\nDay four\n\nThis was one of those days when you think: \"Ok, how can I quit this now?\" And the answer is, basically, you can't. At this point, there's no exit from the trail that would take you to people faster. There's no way around the upcoming Toutle Drop (I'll get to it in a minute). There's no quitting, only pushing ahead and hoping you can make it, which at this point was not a sure thing.\n\nI had my sip of water for breakfast and hit the trail. Since I haven't eaten much and started to get fairly dehydrated, I got to the point of being slightly delirious. I had to take breaks every few hundred yards ‚Äî¬†taking my pack off, spreading my sleeping pad, and just laying down for a few minutes. The next 2 miles were the longest two miles in my life.\n\nLuckily, I met another hiker, who was generous enough to share half a bottle of water with me. I've taken a picture of him on his phone in return, and was incredibly grateful for the water and some tips on what awaits me ahead.\n\nAhead was the Toutle Drop. I don't think it's an official name of this feature, but every hiker I've met referred to it like this.\n\nRight there, at the very bottom of this by far the deepest canyon on the trail, there is a tiny stream. It's Toutle River, and in fact, it's not so tiny, it's just very far below.\n\nThe Drop is a sharp descent over a slope of the canyon. You go down on loose pomace and volcanic ash. One sloppy or unsteady step, and you will lose your footing and tumble hundreds of feet down to the bottom of the canyon.\n\nBy the time I got to the final ~30 feet rope-climb down to the river, I was set on spending the rest of my day right there, by the water. All the water I can drink! Flowing, roaring, splashing! Sweet, sweet unlimited water!\n\nI spent about 3 hours by the river. There was not a spot of shade, so I covered myself with my sleeping mat, and just laid there for hours, drifting asleep, hot and tired. Every now and again, I'd go and refill my water bottle, drink it all, doze off for a bit and repeat. I even ate half of one of my sweet food items: even if I can't hold it and vomit it right away, at least I'd have enough water to recover quickly. It went fairly well, and provided some necessary calories and a slight energy boost.\n\nIn front of me was a daunting uphill stretch of over 2000 ft of elevation. Also, there was an intersection where I could attempt to exit the trail: I could hike lower, take a trail that goes parallel to Loowit trail, and pop out at a road leading to the Climbers Bivouac. By my estimations, this path was about a mile longer but offered fewer elevation changes. The biggest downside was that the final mile or so was a roughly 1000 ft ascent, overall elevation gain would be approximately the same as at Loowit trail, and this other trail was unlikely to have any hiker traffic in case I pass out. At this stage of my hike, passing out became a real concern, and I had to keep it in mind.\n\nI refilled my water containers for the last time: there will be no water for the next 8+ miles. Basically, there will be no water all the way to the trailhead parking. Or so I thought. I took another nap at the campground just above the river, and made an executive decision to attempt to exit the trail by taking this other trail I described above. There will still be a chance to return back to the Loowit trail later without losing anything.\n\nI hiked for a couple of miles through the forest and set up camp right over a river beside a sturdy bridge over Sheep Canyon. It was a relief to find more water: it meant that I could have all the water I want for breakfast and refill once more before the final push to the parking lot. I was very much set on finishing tomorrow, no matter what.\n\nDay five\n\nI woke up early and was in a good mood. I was still weak, exhausted, and ached all over from sleeping on a deflated sleeping pad, but it was my last day on the trail. The plan was this: I hike to the trailhead, get into my car, drive to Vancouver, WA, eat Wendy's Double Baconator and gulp a large diet Vanilla Ginger Ale, spend the night at a nice hotel, take a shower and do the laundry, and drive home the next morning.\n\nMotivation, unfortunately, is not enough for pushing through 8 miles of very challenging mountain terrain. I've barely eaten in 5 days, poorly hydrated, sore all over; the sun is mercilessly shining, deep canyons with rope climbing and another set of lava boulder fields lie ahead.\n\nHonestly, I remember very little about this day. I remember taking long breaks every few hundred yards. Just laying down for a few minutes (hours?), rationing water, and dreaming about Vanilla Ginger Ale.\n\nI set myself a miles countdown: 2 miles before the parking lot, I'd hit the approach trail ‚Äî 2 miles of 100% downhill. So I subtracted these 2 miles from whatever milage I had left. Roughly speaking, I just needed to push through about 6 miles of the trail to get to this final trail intersection and then just descent to the parking lot.\n\n...Of course, I ran out of water about 3 miles before my target intersection.\n\n...At sunset, I met two hikers who shared some water with me, and strongly suggested I spend the night in a little patch of trees right ahead of me: attempting to cross another boulder field at night in my condition concerned them gravely, and I concurred. I crossed a patch of boulders, entered a tree patch, spotted a tiny opening besides the trail, and set there for the night. Words \"Cowboy camping\" popped into my clouded mind, and given that was pretty much unable to think straight or do much, I decided to give it a shot. Cowboy camping is, basically, camping without a tent. You just unroll your sleeping mat, lay down, and sleep under the stars. Not in a nice hotel after a double baconator as planned, but right there in the bushes, with one of my dry sacks as a pillow and with a buff covering my face and ears from insects.\n\nIn all honesty, it wasn't too bad. And the night sky was absolutely, incredibly covered with stars with Milky Way visible so clearly, I didn't know it was even possible to see it like this. As for the insects ‚Äî my biggest concern ‚Äî aside from a few random ants crossing my legs a few times, no one bothered me.\n\nFinale\n\nWell, this Saturday had to be my last day. With just about 2-3 miles to the parking lot trail and 2 miles of downhill, I had to make it there today. I woke up at about 6 o'clock, and by then I knew what to expect. In a few minutes, runners will start passing by. About an hour or so later, I'll meet the first hikers. In about 2 hours, I'll meet the majority of people who started the trail today. By this time, all of it was clear and very predictable. I got up stuffed my dew-soaked quilt into the pack and started my final hike.\n\nI ran out of water pretty quickly. I didn't have much to begin with, probably 4 or 5 sips, and the adventures of the week took their toll ‚Äî I had to drink. I met a few people in the next mile or so, mostly runners, and you don't ask runners for water: they are on the clock, and they have smaller water reserves. I was lucky, again, to meet a fellow hiker who looked at me after I asked for a sip of water and just refilled my whole bottle. He explained that he's been in a similar situation more than once, and it was time for him to pay it forward. I was so grateful! A full bottle of water! I drank half of it within minutes :)\n\nCrossing the last boulder field, dried out Swift creek, and ‚Äî finally ‚Äî¬†here's the intersection with a trail going downhill to the parking lot! I made it!\n\nAbout an hour later, I put my backpack in the trunk of my car and left Climbers Bivouac. Alive, hungry, dehydrated, sore, and aching all over, dirty but happy that I made it.\n\nLessons Learned\n\nDehydrated food is nice, but it's useless without water. The same goes for sweet food. Also, always test any new trail food before taking it with you. There's a chance you are not compatible with it.\n\nFewer _moving part_s next time: no inflatable sleeping pad ‚Äî¬†no problem. No stove, no problem. You get the idea.\n\nWater planning and management are key. Especially if you drink a lot. Consider trails with water readily available instead of hiking trails known for their long dry stretches.\n\nCowboy camping is ok. Not a fan, but it's totally an option in an open space. Wouldn't do it in a forest, though.\n\nIf you're set on a trail that you think maybe more challenging than what you can handle, consider your exit strategy. More than once I thought about exiting the trail. And every time I convinced myself that I shouldn't. If I had a clear strategy of when, where, why, and how I could exit, I'd probably cut the trip short but also wouldn't suffer as much :)\n\nHave your location beacon ready. More than once I was this close to pushing the SOS button and just giving up. I passed out a few times and had difficulty standing up, and thought that this is it, an SOS situation. Ironically, it gave me a sense of confidence: well, I can always call for help, so let me just try and push a bit further, and if I absolutely cannot move anymore, I'll do the SOS thing. I never did, of course, but this option was very much on the table.\n\nNow what?\n\nFor about 3 days after I got back home, I was recovering from severe dehydration and also eating like crazy. I bought a watermelon, a bunch of grapes, and a ton of other juicy fruit. I drank a lot, and it's hard to appreciate tap water enough until you have no access to water for days. All things considered, I recovered fairly quickly. But I still haven't unpacked my backpack.\n\nFor about a week after my return home, I was absolutely, 100% done with backpacking forever. Never again will I voluntarily subject myself to this kind of experience! NEVER!\n\nAbout 2 weeks later, as I finishing this story, I'm thinking about where can I go next? What short, 1-2-night hike is easy enough yet interesting and exciting? And as of the time of this writing, I've got a few ideas ;) But to be completely honest, my 2020 backpacking season is probably over. I'm likely to take a few day hikes, an overnight maybe, but that's about it. Next year, I'll do this whole Loowit trail again, clockwise this time, earlier in the year when the water is abundant and all creeks are still flowing. With this experience, it's going to be a breeze and walk in a park! Right? RIGHT?!",

            "content_html": "I took a week off from hiking and planned to resume my adventures last Wednesday after work. I've got two days off (Thursday and Friday) and decided it's a great opportunity to try and go on a 3-night & 23-mile backpacking trip near Glacier Peak. Let me just say that it ended up being a 12-mile 2-night trip... 20 miles away from the trail I've initially planned to hike. It's a funny story, actually.\n\nLet me back up a little. I plan my hikes in advance, and I put quite a bit of work into this planning. I want to know what to expect, what to prepare for, what to look forward to. Before I arrive at the trailhead, I usually have a map, a backup map, a plan, a route, planned campsites, Plan B campsites, water sources, sketchy river crossings, and more. I also try to tailor the gear and supplies I take with me to the specifics of the trail I'm about to spend a few days on.\n\nThis trip was no exception. I planned to hike a 23-mile loop, starting at North Fork Skykomish river trailhead and going counter-clockwise via Cady Ridge towards Dishpan Gap and back along the river. It supposed to take me 3 full days (allowing for unexpected) and included climbing Benchmark Mountain and hiking about 6 miles of the Pacific Crest Trail.\n\nI planned to arrive at the trailhead before dark on Wednesday; it sounded like a sure thing. The road to the trailhead was a fairly straight line from Index, WA which is fairly close to my house. With offline maps in hand, I packed my pack, got into my car, and took off.\n\nNow. When you turn a corner and see an old mossy sign saying that the road is closed ahead, don't disregard it. Maybe the sign is there for a reason, and Google Maps, Apple Maps, and some other maps just don't know better. This was my first mistake ‚Äî trusting technologies instead of a road sign. Anywho, about 13 miles from the trailhead I stopped at a road barricade saying \"Road Closed\". I was in such a shock that I didn't even take a photo, but here's the exact spot of the barricade.\n\nOr here:\n\nAnyway, suffice to say, the \"Road Closed\" sing was ironic redundant. Apparently, this section of the road washed away in 2006 and is now North Fork Skykomish river ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è\n\nPicture this: 30 minutes before sunset, you're in the middle of nowhere. Your GPS tells you to take the riverbed for another 30 minutes, and you have no Plan B for this type of situation. What to do? Go home, admit defeat, regroup, and try again tomorrow? But then a 3-night hike would turn into a 2-night hike, and also it's just lame. Try to find a different road? Perhaps, but who knows how long it would take, and also what if there is no other road?!\n\nWell, regroup and adapt is basically my life motto. So I regrouped. And adapted. What other trails I know in the vicinity that would guarantee at least 3 days' worth of backpacking, have campsites and I know something about the trail itself? Bingo! There's a spot where PCT crosses Highway 2 just 30 minutes east of Index. I know PCT. I know there are campsites, water sources, and attractions, and boy does PCT guarantee 3 days' worth of hiking!.. Onward!\n\nAt sunset, I arrived at Stevens Pass. I decided to take the northbound trail; I parked my car, geared up, and stepped on the trail. It's going to be an adventure!\n\nAbout half a mile in, I realized that I forgot my hiking poles in the trunk. It wouldn't be a problem if my tent didn't require these poles. Alas, I went all the way back to the parking lot, mumbling quite elaborate curses under my breath. By the time I stepped on the trail again, it was dark. I already made the decision to attempt my first actual night hike (disregard forced night hike at White Pass!), so I strapped on my headlamp, turned it on, and went ahead.\n\nThis section of the trail goes through ancestral land of Skokomish Nation. This particular section is on the very outskirts of their lands since the tribe historically lives along the Skykomish river, still this is Skokomish Indian Tribe land.\n\nThe new plan was to reach Valhalla Lake. Ironically, it's one of the super-popular hiking destinations in the area ‚Äî¬†I try really hard to avoid popular hikes at all costs. But remember? Regroup and adapt! So the new plan was to attempt this 6+ mile hike (~1,800 feet of elevation gain) and set up camp at the lake. The next day, hike along the PCT as far as I can, and the day after, push to get back in one go. Plan B was to hike right now as far as I can or until I find a suitable place to pitch up my tent. This Plan B very soon turned into Plan A. Hiking at night in the relative wilderness on an unfamiliar trail is very exciting, but since my ultimate goal was to get back home in one piece, I decided that I'll stop as soon as I find a good place for a tent.\n\nCrossing streams in the dark with only a headlamp illuminating the way is such a surreal experience! The shimmering water, sparkling rocks, and complete darkness. A thrill!\n\nAbout 3 miles in, I found a spot by a creek and decided to spend the night there. Since setting up my tent in the dark is now my second nature, it only took me about 10 minutes to get all set for the night.\n\nI didn't get much sleep. Not sure if it was the excitement of an adventure, anxiety about ruined plans, or something else entirely, but I woke up groggy and sore. I refilled my water, had breakfast, and spent probably an hour just relaxing, enjoying nature, and not doing jack squat. At this point, I made an executive decision to hike to lake Valhalla and reassess my options. Should I hike further? Or should I spend the night at the lake and go back? ü§î\n\nThe hike was beautiful, as expected. Pretty easy, gentle incline, lots of shade and places to pause and breath.\n\nThe views are stunning, and I got really lucky considering a bunch of rain in the forecast.\n\nAround 2 in the afternoon, I arrived at Lake Valhalla. It's a regular lake. Just a lake. Like, just like any other lake. It's pretty, but it's not a gem or something.\n\nWhatever. By the time I got there, it was clear that my sleepless night left me no choice but to set up camp and take a nap. Which I did.\n\nI napped for a few hours with bees buzzing in the background and hungry mosquitoes staring at me through the net side of my tent. When I woke up, I decided that I'm not going anywhere today. I'll stay here, make dinner, get some good night's sleep and see how it goes. Do I hike further? Do I turn back? I'll think about it tomorrow.\n\nWhen tomorrow came, I was conflicted about my immediate future. On one hand, I came here to hike, and turning back is admitting defeat. On the other hand, I have nowhere to hike, really; I don't know if there are significant features further down the trail, I don't have a mile count in place to make sure I can return in time. I already wasted almost a day at the lake napping. Well, I guess it only makes sense to cut this short, return to the trailhead, and go back home. Breakfast, water refill, packing ‚Äî and off I go.\n\nIt was raining half of my way back, and I was too lazy to put on my raincoat. What's the point? I'll be in my car in, like, an hour, and will dry out within minutes. Also, who doesn't love rain? What's wrong with you?! :)\n\nOn my way back home, I thought I'd get some closure and find the road to my originally planned trailhead. Before doing so, I stopped for a quick minute in a tiny town of Skykomish (~200 residents) and went to their world-famous Great Northern & Cascade Railway museum. It's tiny but welcoming and cute, and if you ask nicely, they'll show you their collection of telegraph keys and tell a story about 20,000 telegraph operators who were serving the road in the past and refused to teach their trade to anyone outside of their immediate families.\n\nAnd after some more research, I figured out the road to the trailhead I was originally planning to go to. It took me over an hour to cover something around 20 miles from Skykomish to the trailhead, but I did it.\n\nAt the end of the day, I got to hike for a bit, spend two lazy days in nature, spooked a marmot, and found a way to the trailhead. Good times!\n\nNext week is my vacation week, and I'm doing the Loowit trail ‚Äî a 33-mile loop around Mt. St. Helens.\n\nP.S. Here's the report from my Loowit Trail hike üî•",

Now I'm thinking it would be madness to attempt the Stevens Pass to Snoqualmie Pass, Section J, of the PCT this year. Hell, I'm not even sure I can do my Plan B, the Loowit Trail anymore! But hey, let me decompress a little, think, plan some more, and see how it goes.\n\n60,000+ steps, 600 floors.\n\nI also lost 8 lbs in 2 days.\n\nThe plan was simple: arrive at Sloan Creek campground on Thursday, camp for the night. On Friday hike to White Pass. On Saturday hike back. Simple enough.\n\nAs always, I had a plan B: hike to Mackinaw shelter, camp there, and hike back on Saturday. This would be a chill and relaxed 12 miles over two days.\n\nNorth Fork Sauk River ‚Äî Washington Trails Association\n\nAdventure\n\nThis was my first Hard trail, and I didn't expect it to be any less than a painful struggle with a payoff in a form of a spectacular overview of Washington's Cascade peaks and chill evenings in my tent.\n\nOf course, nothing went according to plan.\n\nI arrived at the parking lot later than planned. I knew that Mountain Loop highway was pretty bad, and indeed 16 miles from Darrington down to Forest Service road 49 (it's actually marked as NF-49, National Forest road) and then about 7 miles to the trailhead took me over an hour. The road is rough but passable, even for someone in a Civic Coupe.\n\nAnyway, Thursday night was pretty empty at the campground, and I had no issue setting up my tent in a secluded area not too far from the river.\n\nIt was raining a little bit, and setting up a new tent for the first time in the wild was not too fun. Moreover, apparently, I didn't bring enough ground stakes. As a result, I didn't get proper ventilation inside the tent overnight and I woke up all damp and wet: condensation is a bitch.\n\nAfter breakfast, I hit the trail towards Mackinaw Shelter, a known landmark at the end of the North Fork Saul trail right before it climbs uphill to White Pass. Unfortunately, the shelter collapsed a few years ago. Now it's just a bunch of rubble :(\n\nStill, there's a nice campground area around with river access, and it's perfectly suited for a nice and chill overnight or a relaxing lunch break.\n\nThe trail all the way to the shelter goes relatively flat along the North Fork Sauk river through Sauk-Suiattle native land. It's mostly shaded and crosses a bunch of tiny streams. There's only one place on the trail that requires some scrambling due to a downed tree.\n\nQuiet, chill stroll among the old-growth forest. A lot of moss, green, shade, a lot of little critters running around. Mosquitos are a concern.\n\nAnyway, after a quick lunch at Mackinaw Shelter campground, I made an executive decision to proceed all the way to White Pass, 3,000 ft ascent over ~3 miles. It was around 4 pm and I figured I'd be there before dark. Boy, was I wrong.\n\nThe trail starts at around 3,000 ft of elevation, and for the next 3 miles, it goes straight up. Yes, there are switchbacks, but it's for real, a full-on ascent non-stop. There are no flat segments. The trail itself is much different from a soft forest trail. It's very rocky in places, there are a few spots where the trail becomes a stream for a few yards; on my way back, I slipped and fell flat on my butt in one of these streams üòÇ\n\nI was moving very slowly. I was taking short breaks every few hundred yards, long breaks every 500 ft of elevation gain. Yes, my pace was at about 2 hours/mile, but I'm absolutely convinced that this approach is the only reason I was able to make it all the way to the top. But you know what they say: HYOH.\n\nThe weather was fairly clear, but the ascent was so strenuous that I took only a few pictures. \"After I get to the top, tomorrow, I'll make all the pictures in the world, from a better position!\", I thought.\n\nI ended up traveling the last mile and a half in complete darkness. My headlamp died on me, it started drizzling, and a thick fog settled around. So here I am, in the dark, on a narrow trail on a mountainside with about 3000-feet drop on the right and a vertical hill on the left; by this time, I ran out of water and illuminated my way with my iPhone flashlight. After a Fucking Fuck creek (yes, I named a dried out creek, sue me!), I finally came across a stream and refilled my water bottle. I successfully made it to the intersection of my trail with the PCT, and from there it was a fairly easy hike to the White Pass camp area.\n\nWhen my iPhone died, I found another, dimmer flashlight and used it to navigate the camp area. In the fog, at night, and through the drizzle, it was not easy. So much so that as soon as I saw a lit tent in the distance, I started to look for any flat surface to pitch my tent. While stumbling around a meadow, I startled a bunch of deer, who didn't expect me there at that hour, I guess.\n\nNow, I'm in some meadow, exhausted, wet, aching all over, my backup flashlight is about to die, and I need to pitch a tent that is still very new to me. It took me about 20 minutes to complete this task, and by the time I got inside and set my sleeping system, it was close to midnight. I sent a check-in message to the family and dropped asleep.\n\nYeah, the morning was refreshing. It was cloudy and foggy, and you couldn't see anything anywhere. Which is a pity; one of the points of hiking this high and seeing all the peaks and volcanoes... Oh, well.\n\nHere's a picture of gorgeous 10,500-feet Glacier Peak, known in the Sauk-Suiattle dialect of the Lushootseed language as \"Tda-ko-buh-ba\" or \"Takobia\". It is the most isolated stratovolcano in the Cascade Range. Beautiful, isn't it? It's the 4th highest point in Washington after Tahoma, Pahto, and Kulshan (Rainier, Adams, and Baker)\n\nAfter breakfast, I refilled all my water containers and headed back to the parking lot. White Pass is a pretty busy area at this time of year with a lot of hikers and climbers arriving on Saturday morning. By this time I looked dirty, wet, and tired enough for incoming hikers to ask me where the nearest water source is, how to get to the camp or this other trail, where toilets are and so on. On my long and fairly slow descent, I met a lot of people (mostly climbers) and we had a few brief conversations. A bunch of people who overtook me were in my camp of disappointed by the weather.\n\nA quick peek-a-boo of Mt. Jackson is all I've got on my way back. I can only imagine how fantastically beautiful the scenery is on a clear day!..\n\nI wanted to stop at Mackinaw Shelter again on my way back for a break and water refill, but I missed it. I was looking for a creek crossing first, never crossed this creek, and when I finally got to it, well, Mackinaw Shelter was like 2 miles back.\n\nThe creek I was looking for was Red Creek; it has a nice camping area with a ton of spacious dispersed tent spots, firepits and such. But for me, it was all about the creek at that point. I just laid on my back beside roaring water before refilling my water bottle and heading straight back to the parking lot.\n\nAbout a mile away from the trailhead, another peek-a-boo happened, that I didn't really expect. It was just after sunset, and it was a nice (if a bit ironic) closure to my peak-watching hike.\n\nNotes\n\nI forgot my hat and had to fashion headgear out of a face mask (?)\n\nLooks like, as always, I carried 70% more food than needed. I literally only had 2 breakfasts and 2 snacks. I brought 4 full meals and most snacks back.\n\nAfter my hectic night arrival at White Pass, my pack got disorganized beyond repair. By morning, I was unable to organize it back to the proper state. Need to learn this skill.\n\nMy hiking shoes are .5 size too small. I mean, they are half a size larger than I'd normally wear, but it's still too small. Will try to exchange them for a bigger pair at REI ü§û\n\nI ran out of bug spray. There must be some other way to repel mosquitos without bathing in bug spray ü§î\n\nNever ever under any circumstances cut costs on your headlamp. Buy the best and most reliable one, it could save you not only a ton of comfort at night but also a leg or your life.\n\nI love using a hydration bladder, it's so convenient. But it's such a hassle to refill it (take it out of the pack, wash it, fill it, put it back, connect a filter). Not sure what to do about it.\n\nLessons Learned\n\nI can hike 3,000 feet up over 3 miles and not die.\n\nI can set up an unfamiliar tent in total darkness in the rain with only a phone's flashlight.\n\nGoing down is easier, but it will still fuck you up in the end, although not as much as going up.\n\nWhen I'm exhausted I turn numb: I no longer feel pain in my muscles or remember to drink or eat. This is a blessing and a curse: I can go farther and longer as a result without much pain or suffering, but I also get dehydrated, could injure myself mildly without realizing it for a while, become less aware of my surroundings, and get generally sluggish and a bit wobbly.\n\nI need to fit my pack better. Something happened to it along the way, and it really did a number on my shoulders and upper back.",

            "content_html": "Time for my weekly hiking report. For further accountability, I'm planning a week-long PCT hike from Stevens Pass to Snoqualmie Pass in early September, and that's a big reason why I'm trying to stick to this weekly training schedule. The hike I'll attempt is a 63-mile stretch of the Pacific Crest Trail with a total elevation gain of over 15,000 ft, so it makes sense to give my best shot at shorter and easier hikes at first, and gradually increase difficulty. Unsurprisingly, ever hike is much easier to hike than the one a week earlier: it's like my body really missed this kind of thing, and soaks it all in. Also, there's certainly a kind of low base effect: my fitness level is barely above zero, so it's fairly easy to make progress :)\n\nThis week I hit a trail that was marked as moderate in difficulty and heavy trafficked. It was one of the most enjoyable hikes I had so far, and while I wouldn't consider it \"easy\", it's probably on the easier side of \"moderate\".\n\nThe trail goes over Sauk-Suiattle ancestral land ‚Äî it's basically next door (right across the ridge) to the Monte Cristo trail I hiked last week. It gently eases you into gradual ascent, offering some truly stunning views along the Elliot Creek. The creeks flow out of the Goat Lake, originally called Sweetleehachu by Sauk-Suiattle people. As soon as you get to the top of the waterfall, you've reached your destination.\n\nThere's a section of the trail where you can choose your own adventure: hike like a normal person on a bunch of switchbacks but miss the bottom of the waterfall, or go straight to the bottom of the waterfall.\n\nIf you choose to check out the falls, you'll have to then climb (and I mean climb) about 150 feet, pretty much vertically, over about 130 yards of distance. It's fun, a change of pace and it was a bit of a challenge for me. Just a couple of switchbacks later you get a first glimpse of the lake:\n\nThe lake is absolutely gorgeous. It's quiet, serene, clear, and ice-cold. Although the trail is marked as heavily trafficked, I only met, like, 5 other parties along the trail, one other group at the lake, and when the left, I got the whole lake to myself.\n\nMy lunch spot this time was right on the lake shore, but I was not hungry enough to cook. I munched a few strips of bacon jerky, refilled my hydration pack with filtered lake water, chilled for a bit and headed back, leaving this view behind.\n\nOn my way back with about 1.7 miles left to the trailhead, I had my first wild bear encounter. We didn't exchange pleasantries but gave each other a nod: two apex predators, one ‚Äî stinky, grumpy and dangerously hungry, and the other one ‚Äî a friendly American black bear.\n\nEncountering a bear was a fresh experience. Throughout this hike, I heard weird noises more than a few times. Snapping branches, strange grumbling sounds, random tree shaking and such. So I was well aware that there's wildlife around me and was actively scanning and making occasional noises to make sure I don't startle an animal. As a result, this little fella knew I was nearby when our eyes met. The bear had a look of something between mild curiosity and indifference, so I braved taking this grainy picture from about 30-40-yard distance and was on my way back to the trailhead.",

            "content_html": "Just got back from my weekly hike. This one was fairly relaxing, and I'd even say it was more of a walk in a park but with extra steps (and obstacles). The first obstacle was the drive: the trailhead is 1.5 hours away from my house, but it's an easy and nice drive on a day like this.\n\n...In 1907 the township of Monte Cristo had been abandoned by the miners and eventually turned into a resort of sorts. The recreational enterprise turned out to be more successful than mining operations, and the town survived for a few decades. In 1983, after the Lodge was destroyed by a fire, the town was finally abandoned for good. It stays there for the past almost 40 years as a ghost of itself. Very few original structures from the late 1800 and early 1900 remain on-site, and it's safe to say that the site now has more recreational than historic value.\n\nStill, it's a ghost town, and you can only get there by following the old Monte Cristo Road turned into a hiking trail.\n\nThe trail goes over Sauk-Suiattle ancestral land, mostly along the Sauk River. The name \"Sauk\" comes from the Sah-kee-ma-hu ‚Äî the name of the tribe in Lushootseed, one of the Coast Salish languages native to the Pacific Northwest. The river is ice cold and furious at times, with roaring rapids and cute little waterfalls.\n\nThe trail is fairly level and flat with about 790 ft of elevation gain along its 9-mile out-and-back course. Plenty of shade, scenic rest spots, and only a few rough and rocky segments.\n\nThe trickiest part is crossing the Sauk early on: the bridge and old road got washed away and the only way to cross is either by fallen trees or ford it. It's shallow enough to cross in waterproof shoes.\n\nIn all honesty, the township itself is underwhelming. Just a few buildings (all of them are \"new\"), an old mining cart, a railroad turntable, and a few artifacts from the old town. It would be better if the trail was called \"Old Monte Cristo Road\" to establish proper expectations.\n\nAll in all, a nice relaxing hike perfect for a lazy day-off. It's worth mentioning that there's plenty of camping spots and campgrounds along the trail, so I may be checking it out again for a quick overnight someday.",

I plan to do one hike every week, and do an overnight hike somewhere in the North Cascades by the end of summer.\n\nThere are different reasons for hiking. Some hike because it's a workout, some tend to go on a hike to hunt for Instagram photos. For some it's a conquest: to claim, to get to the top, to finish a 50-mile loop in a day. For me personally it's an adventure. I walk, through woods, rivers and mountains, I explore this \"wilderness\", I make some camping food for lunch making it with the river water. I don't care about elevation gain or distance (other than in practical terms: can I make it?); I don't care about the scenery per se, although I like when I can bring back some pictures. I don't care if I finish the trail. I don't care if I overcome something, \"survive\" or whatever.

In our last installment, we walked through the reason behind the project and my vague ideas about how to go about it.\n\n‚ÄãNow, I've been tinkering with the project for a little bit and want to share some of my observations and where things stand at the moment.\n\nNot much has changed in how I think I will approach task rescheduling. However, I tweaked the parameters a bit. Let me recap:\n\nTask age in days multiplied by -(Task priority) = Reschedule Score: a five-day-old task with a no priority (Task priority:4) gets a score of -20. A two-day-old task with top priority (1) will get a score of -2.\n\nTasks are divided into two groups: overdue and future. Tasks within each group are sorted descending by Reschedule Score: a task with the score of -2 will be ranked higher than a task with a score of -20. I bet there's a more elegant solution, but for now, this will do.\n\nI removed the number of times the task had already been rescheduled before: it's evident to me now that this data point is not relevant: if a task has been rescheduled 20 times, it doesn't add anything to its importance (likely, the other way around). For now, I removed it from the equation.\n\nExtra data: I decided to also fetch labels and projects from Todoist. I don't know yet how I'm going to use it exactly (other than showing what task belongs to what project/label). I also decided to fetch my overall Todoist stats (completed tasks, Karma, and so on), so that if I get to create a UI, I have all the data I want to showcase.\n\nNext steps\n\nNext, I need to figure out how to go about, well, rescheduling tasks. As of this moment, the plan is this:\n\nFigure out a good way to grade future days based on how many tasks they have and how important these tasks are. Maybe, priority multiplied by the number of tasks? I need to figure out a way to reverse priority so that a top priority task weighs more than a low priority. A day with 3 medium priority tasks and 2 top priority tasks will then have a day score of 12. I can set a maximum capacity for a given day of 15 points, so for such a day, I'll only be able to add one top priority task or 1 medium priority and 1 low priority, or 3 low priority tasks. Not sure it's smart enough, though ü§î\n\nFigure out the actual rescheduling process. I mean, literally, how do I reschedule tasks using Todoist API? Do I need to specify the due time and date or is the date enough? Can I reschedule tasks relatively, as in \"reschedule this 5 days in future if task score fits day's capacity\"?\n\nDo I need a backup? Should I store fetched tasks somewhere just in case?\n\nIs there any existing \"science\" behind rescheduling stuff?\n\nTypeScript\n\nI get distracted by shiny new objects really easily. Last night, I came across two fairly old talks on TypeScript:\n\nThis talk is so old that arrow functions, classes, and string literals had already made their way into JavaScript!In this one, TypeScript 3.8 is announced. We are at 4.0 already!\n\nAs a result, I've completely rewritten my little serverless fetchTasks.js in TypeScript. It's a fantastic low-pressure introduction. Since TypeScript compiles to plain JavaScript, it remains a valid serverless lambda function, while I get to take full advantage of TypeScript: types, amazing IDE support, suggestions, and so on. And since I'm at the ground level of this project, it was really easy to figure out what types and interfaces I need and where I can get the most benefits moving forward.\n\nAnyway, stick around if you want to see me stumble around and make this thing happen after all!\n\nBonus\n\nHere's a sneak peek of what my current function returns. Future tasks are also included. All of this is also sorted by rescheduleScore and importanceScore for past due and future tasks respectively. As you can see, there's an interesting bug/feature: tasks that are due tomorrow (within a few hours from now) are considered overdue (which is a bug) but receive the highest rescheduleScore (which is a feature). I will fix this later by making sure that tasks with zero days left are not considered overdue ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è",

            "content_html": "It's been just over 6 months since I joined Auth0 as their newest Developer Support Engineer. A bunch of my highbrow friends was very condescending. \"Oh, tech support. Good for you. With time, you'll become a real engineer\". I shrugged these comments off back then, but now I think it was cute of them to say things like this. As in \"Aww, honey. You have no idea what you're talking about\" :)\n\nThe main reason for my chirpy attitude towards my then-new position has always been the fact that I enjoy troubleshooting and solving unexpected and obscure practical, real-life problems. I also really enjoy helping smarter people figure out stuff that I know more about. Not only does it expose me to a wide variety of systems and engineering approaches, but it also gives me a chance to connect with some fantastic people and soak in a ton of exclusive experiences. When you get to collaborate with some of the brightest engineers from the most forward-looking companies in the world on their critical cybersecurity infrastructure, it's something that is very easy for me to enjoy.\n\nI came up with some quick observations as well as misconceptions I want to share.\n\nPeople who ask for help are not stupid\n\nA common misconception in the IT world is that people who reach out to their support are dumb. They can't figure things out on their own. They don't know what they are doing. They ask dumb questions. You get the idea. This can't be further from the truth.\n\nIn my case, identity and cybersecurity are extremely complex (to put it mildly), and the smartest people, smartest engineers reach out to us when they exhaust every other option available to them. There's nothing else they can do without some very specific expertise. In no way am I implying here that I now possess this expertise, but I certainly am in a better position to provide helpful advice. Sometimes, this advice is very specific to Auth0, but sometimes it's more specific to identity quirks (and by identity I mean authorization, authentication, user identity, role-based access control, OAuth, OIDC, and a multitude of other protocols, and so forth). It's so cool, I can't even.\n\nBe clear who's side you are on\n\nThis can be a bit controversial. I always make it clear that even though I work at Auth0, I'm here to represent the customer within Auth0. I first consider whatever the pain they encountered to be our fault. It's kind of an \"innocent until proven guilty\" approach: a customer got in a pickle and it's on us until or unless I can prove otherwise. I find this perspective to be quite helpful. You don't ask \"have you tried turning it off and on again\", you assume that you are the last resort for the customer. They tried everything and ended up nowhere. Is it because our docs are bad? Is it because our product is difficult to use? Is it a bug on our end? An outage? Until I can rule these out, it's on me to make sure the customer is aware of what I'm looking for first.\n\nWhen we implement a change that affects customers, I made it a point to get a clear message to them: I will raise hell internally to make sure that the customer's voice is heard loud and clear, and that their concerns will be taken seriously.\n\nScrew-ups happen\n\nIn the last 6 months, I screwed up more than once. I've sent a response meant for one customer to a different person with a different issue. I sent responses that were factually wrong. I misassigned a case in such a way that it went unnoticed for a week. I probably missed an SLA for a ticket resolution more than once. These things do happen and will happen, even in such a diverse, distributed, remote team of talented personalities as we have. They do happen less often with experience, yet there's no way to avoid this stuff entirely. Which brings us to my next point.\n\nSincere apologies go a long way\n\nThere are a few ways to apologize for your mistakes. One way is to say that you apologize for the poor experience. Another one is to express something along these lines:\n\nShit, I screwed up :( Like, I'm so very sorry. Jeez, what a disaster. This is not at all how I want you to experience Auth0. I'll make it up to you.\n\nObviously, the phrasing is different, but the sentiment remains clear. Whenever possible, I follow up with specifics: here's what happened, here's why I screwed up, these are the steps I'm taking to fix it, and here's why it will never happen again. Only once it didn't go too well: a customer got all snarky and passive-aggressive. Yet, I don't blame them; apologies are not a \"free get out of jail\" card. They are meant to convey, with 100% transparency, your fuckup exactly as it happened and what you're doing in response. That's it. If an occasional customer doesn't accept it, it's their right. At least, I'm doing all I can.\n\nIt's worth saying that in the absolutely vastest majority of cases, a sincere apology turned a disgruntled customer into a raving fan supporter.\n\nYou can't know everything\n\nSometimes I feel like I'm drowning in a sea of information, knowledge, tricks, quirks, specifics, edge cases, and so on. One of my much senior colleagues demonstrated early on that there's no shame in not knowing something. Not because it's ok to be lazy and stop learning things, but because there's absolutely no way a single person can possibly know everything, even in their special area of expertise. If I don't know something, I just go and learn about it and move on. That's it.\n\nYou know the product better than most\n\nThis one is my favorite. As a developer support engineer, I get to touch pretty much every aspect of Auth0 products. I mean it: from sales to UI all the way to the core underlying tech and concepts. And I venture here and there on a daily basis. I won't pretend that I, in fact, do know our products better than most, not by a long shot. But also ‚Äî not yet. Being exposed to all sorts of complex problems each element of Auth0 deals with and solves, not only helps me stay on my toes but also offers a great 30-thousand-feet view of everything we do as well as specific lines of code that are responsible for every aspect of the product.",

            "content_html": "I've been sad recently since Todoist removed the Smart Reschedule feature from the application. For me personally, it was one of the most used features. Whenever I get overwhelmed with overdue tasks, usually on Fridays, I'd just hit \"Reschedule\". Todoist would just move all overdue tasks to the next week, minding their priority, existing daily task load, and so forth. Now that it's gone, my first instinct was to look for a different tool. Unfortunately, there's nothing there that I like enough to switch. And then I thought: wait a second, why can't I implement something like this myself? I mean, there's an API available from Todoist, I've got my VS Code and some spare time on my hands... So here goes.\n\nHonestly, I have no idea where it's going or whether something will come of it. I'm just going to document it for the time being and see how it goes.\n\nPlan\n\nSo, Todoist has an API available to developers. There's a bunch of stuff I'll be using, but first and foremost ‚Äî¬†authentication.\n\nWith this out the way, let's move on to the sync endpoint. This endpoint provides us with whatever we're looking for, by resource type (literally, it's called resource_type).\n\nhttps://developer.todoist.com/sync/v8/\n\nI can request all tasks right here by specifying resource_type=[\"items\"]. Now we are getting somewhere. Here's what a sample item looks like.\n\nWhat we need here is the item's priority, due date information, content, date added to figure out the item's age, whether it's deleted or not, and whether it's completed or not. This is the bare minimum, that would allow us to know if we should care about the item (not completed, not deleted), is the item overdue (is the due date in the past), how old the item is, what's its priority and what it's all about.\n\nJust for the sake of argument, here's a basic function to fetch some of this data:\n\nIt's not perfect, but it works. What I get in return is an array of items of interest with some of their metadata. Great start. Let's leave it at that for now.\n\nWhat's next\n\nNow that I've got items I'm interested in, time to think about what am I going to do with them.\n\nAnalyze\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation for 10 upcoming days. Why 10? No reason. I need to figure out how many upcoming tasks of each priority I've got on each individual day. This will give me a map of the future. With this information, I'll be able to find out the exact number of free spots and how many tasks of different priorities I can reschedule for each day.\n\nProcess the tasks\n\nI need to check some stuff for my overdue items first.\n\nWhen was the task created? This point may or may not be important later since it indicates how old the task is. A task I scheduled 2 years ago is probably something important, and I don't want it to slip through the cracks.\n\nWhen was the original due date? Basically, how long has it been since the task expired? What day of the week was it? I'll try to see if I can reschedule this task to the same day of the week, if possible.\n\nWhat's the original priority? If the task is important, it gets rescheduled first.\n\nCome up with a \"score\". In order to properly prioritize how I reschedule tasks, I will assign them a score. I tried to come up with some sensible way to do this:\n\nNot sure if any of this makes sense, but what I finally came up with is this:\n\nReversed Priority * (Task age in days + how many times has it been rescheduled)\n\nWe'll see if it works or not. For now, I'll stick to this.\n\nI'll post as soon as I get the above working to some extent. Stay tuned.",

However, there are some silver linings there, and one of them I mentioned earlier in a [post about staying entertained during Covid-19: tech conferences moving online. Not only that but as a result of increased accessibility, we are getting exposed to a wide and fantastic variety of speakers from across the globe. Every conference now can have any speaker at any time!\n\n\n\nByteconf is an online native. Run by Bytesized, they've been doing online-only conferences for years now. These conferences are free to watch and participate in, and usually bring together a pretty awesome lineup of speakers. This year's Byteconf React 2020 was no exception.\n\nOne of the most impressive things I want to mention is production quality. The whole stream looked super slick, intermissions and music were spot-on, and talks just flowed. Pretty cool, and a great example for others to follow ‚Äî yes, I'm looking at you Svelte Society Day 2020! üôÑ\n\nI love that I can fall behind on live stream of the conference, pause it, rewind and catch up as soon as I my days gets a bit open. Or I can just skip to whatever is happening live at the moment, and catch up with talks I missed sometime later. Try this with a live, in-person event. Go on, I DARE YOU! :)\n\nSpeeding up your Gatsby app in a day ‚Äî Henrique Cavalieri\n\nPretty cool tutorial-like talk by [Henrique Cavalieri](https://henrique.codes/). Quite a few tricks I didn't realize I could apply at all!

I'm going to use this talk as a starting point when I decide to add comments to my theme here.\n\nA Gentle Introduction to Building Serverless Apps ‚Äî Joe Karlsson\n\nPretty awesome and beginner-friendly introduction to serverless apps by Joe Karlsson. If you never really got on the serverless train, it's a great primer and a chance to catch up!\n\nCreating a Component Library ‚Äî Kathryn Grayson Nanz\n\nThis is something I'm yet to implement: Storybook fascinates me, but for some reason, it always seems tedious to use in 1-3 person projects. Anyway, this is a great intro to component libraries from Kathryn Grayson Nanz.\n\nPower Up Gatsby with Auth! ‚Äî Sam Julien\n\nAs a big fan of Gatsby, I tried to implement auth in the past. I made it work, but it was never a clear and obvious process. Thanks to my Auth0 colleague Sam Julien, I was able to implement quicker and more up-to-date auth in a side-project I'm playing around with (it's really early days).\n\nFrom create-react-app to create-any-app ‚Äî Ema Suriano\n\nThis is a pretty awesome one. In fact, I've been thinking about something like this for a while but didn't really know how to approach it and where to start. Thanks to Ema Suriano, now I know :)\n",

            "content_html": "I'm not a gamer. Normally, I don't play video games, casually or otherwise. However, from time to time I enjoy certain titles. I loved Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 4, spent countless hours playing Max Payne 2, Portal (1 & 2), GTA 2, Doom, an assortment of Need for Speed games. I played Factorio for a while; I absolutely love Sayonara Wild Hearts and played a ton of Asphalt 8 and 9. This is a more or less complete history of my relationship with video games. So when I say that I consider Ori and the Blind Forest to be the greatest game of all time, take it with a grain of salt.\n\nOri and the Blind Forest\n\nThe original Ori was a revelation. It's stunningly beautiful, the story is gentle and touching, the characters are relatable, the world of Nibel makes sense, the music is absolutely breathtakingly beautiful, and the controls are easy to learn. This game quickly became our family's favorite; we played it for months, and then played it again and again. After \"The Definitive Edition\" came out, we played it as well, more than once. In 2017 the studio behind Ori announced a sequel, Ori and the Will of the Wisps, and I couldn't have been more excited about it! A new adventure of Ori and his friends in a magical world of mesmerizing beauty and immersive music! I'd followed the development and new announcements very closely, and after quite a few delays, the game came out in March 2020.\n\nI was thrilled! A friend helped me get a copy of the game right away, and I've ordered the Collector's Edition as soon as it became available.\n\nAnd then everything fell apart...\n\nOri and the Will of the Wisps\n\nFirst, without any reservations, Ori and the Will of the Wisps is absolutely fantastic. It's unbelievably beautiful, and every frame, every scene is a true gem. The details are just beyond anything I've ever seen on a TV screen. The spirit and overall atmosphere of the game is truly captivating.\n\nMusic... It's otherworldly. It just takes you away in a swirl of themes and you just float there, weightless and enchanted. My descriptions don't do OST justice it deserves. Here, enjoy!\n\nThe main theme rhymes a lot with the original Ori soundtrack\n\nThe story... It makes sense. It's a logical follow-up to the Blind Forest. We've met all the characters before, we know their backstory and what they went through to arrive here. We know their previous struggles, and we are presented with a new challenge in a captivating intro. Right away, we get a feel of the new Ori world ‚Äî¬†so familiar yet new and exciting!\n\nAnd then the struggle begins. This is purely subjective personal opinion of a non-gamer with limited console experience (well, limited to the previous Ori game, really).\n\nControls\n\nControls are impossible to remember. Original Ori was introducing new control options throughout the game. All the way to the very end you were gently trained on how to use certain abilities, how to do various tricks. By the end of the game, you were using every button of a controller and you got there naturally. In the Will of the Wisps, you're thrown right in, and just a few minutes into the game you have to assign different actions to different buttons, shuffle abilities and their combinations and constantly keep it all in mind as you go. The learning curve just cannot be any steeper. I'm sure it's not an issue for someone who plays a lot, but it's a showstopper for a casual gamer. And it's a significant change from the original Ori. This alone made the Will of the Wisps if not entirely unplayable for me, but extremely challenging and very difficult if not impossible to enjoy.\n\nGameplay\n\nWhat happened with a straightforward, logical, easy to follow story? Who are these people Ori has to interact with constantly? Why all these side quests? What's with a slew of \"currencies\" you need to collect? Merchants? What's going on?! Not only it's difficult to control the character, but the game is now constantly interrupted by a crowd of random needy characters, who constantly make you do stuff. It feels so besides the main storyline, and much more difficult to follow what's going on, what's next, and why you're doing all these quests. Again, I understand that for gamers it's probably a new and exciting development, but for a casual player, it's just beyond confusing.\n\nAchievements and Abilities\n\nThis was the last straw. There are like 5 screens of different types of achievements, abilities, collectible items, tokes, coins, a variety of energy points, combinations of different things. I just couldn't follow it all. What goes where? Do I need more tokens, icons, coins, or keys? How do I get each, and where do I spend it? Do I exchange tokens for abilities or energy? Unsurprisingly, all of this made it definitively impossible to keep playing the game.\n\nAs much as I loved Ori and the Blind Forest, I just can't play Ori and the Will of the Wisps. It's way too complicated, convoluted, overly complex, full of interruptions, and non-linear intermissions. It's way more work and effort. It's not a smooth flow that just takes you along with the story, it's a struggle to keep up with controls, track resources, managing abilities, and purchase achievements.\n\nIt makes me very sad. I understand that the Will of the Wisps is an upgrade in every sense of the word, but it clearly is geared to attract more hardcore gamers. I totally understand this, and I don't blame the studio for trying to capture this audience. But for me... I'm just left out. The new Ori is here, but I can no longer enjoy it.

And today someone asked linking to an article:\n\nDo you think we can bounce back from this?\n\nOpinion | The Best-Case Outcome for the Coronavirus, and the Worst\n\nWe will get hit. Hard.\n\nAt this moment, we are, unfortunately, headed towards the worse scenarios, and things that are about to unfold in the next few weeks are already in motion. We will see Italy all over here for as long as some of the strictest quarantine measures are not mandated and ruthlesslyenforced nationwide. We will be hit, and we will be hit hard. Buckle up, prepare for a long haul, wash your hands, stay home, be kind, and all this; we already know the drill.\n\nBut.\n\nWe can bounce back from this and we most certainly will. It‚Äôs not the first pandemic humanity faces, it‚Äôs not going to be the last one either; this is not an extinction event by any stretch.\n\nWe will adapt, all the best human qualities will be again in the highest regard, and we‚Äôll be surprised how many fantastic human beings were around us all along! We‚Äôll build stronger communities, connections, new ways of doing things, new values ‚Äî and I‚Äôm not talking about toilet paper per se. We will have a healthier economy, even if it‚Äôs going to be 10x smaller. And hopefully, we‚Äôll learn a few things along the way:\n\na lesson in humility\n\nvalue of transparency\n\nimportance of sustainability\n\nwhat leadership is\n\nhow all of humanity is in it together (whatever this it might be)\n\nThese lessons are unlikely to come from our governments (not from the federal government, that's for sure), but they will come from true leaders who are handling the situation with selfless passion as we speak. We all have seen these examples many times already.\n\nLet‚Äôs have each other‚Äôs backs. Check-in. Connect in whichever ways we can. Help those we can help, worry about the things we can actually control, and do what‚Äôs in our power.\n\nWe‚Äôll bounce back, scarred and battered, but stronger and more resilient. Millions of people will die. Millions of people will be disabled for the rest of their lives. And whole generations will never be the same, and will always remember the devastating Coronavirus pandemic of 2020. But on the brighter side, we are likely to see a variety of implementations of UBI across the world, universal healthcare in America along with guaranteed paid sick and family leave (finally!). The economy will shift from pumping imaginary \"value\" into the \"stock market\" to responsible sustainability. We may actually have a fighting chance at slowing down the climate change crisis; we may even come up with creative solutions for it, and survive it after all.\n\nIt's going to be bad. But we will bounce back üí™\n\n\n\n",

How I come to work early to have breakfast, how I enjoy working in the office in general and with this team in particular, but it all changed now (the routine, I mean). We are fully remote at the moment, and generally speaking, it was a relatively easy transition for most of us. Auth0 is remote-friendly by design and from the very beginning, and it definitely helps.\n\nBusiness Continuity at Auth0: Our Response to COVID-19: How we make sure COVID-19 does not disrupt customers' business\n\nThrough all of these changes, it's such a delight to witness teammates, distant colleagues, and company leadership in action. We are provided with an abundance of information, at all times we have every resource imaginable to keep things running smoothly, no question goes unanswered, and the feeling that the team has your back is palpable.\n\nThis spirit of being in the same boat no matter where we are and what's going on is one of the key aspects of company resilience. No matter what, someone got you covered. As a direct result, at all times, someone got customers covered as well. And processes. And everything else.\n\nEugenio, our CEO, posts regular updates of where we stand as a group, but here's what's way more important in times of crisis.\n\nI probably shouldn't share screenshots from our corporate Slack and I may remove it later, if asked to do so. But, hell, this is what leadership looks like. This is what giving a shit, one of Auth0's official company value essentially means.\n\nAnd it's not just a statement. It's the genuine fabric of the company. This is who we are. This is how we do things. This is what we value. We've got your back. We give a shit.\n\nI just realized that I‚Äôve never explained what we do at Auth0, and what‚Äôs my role is. Auth0 provides identity management for application builders so innovators can innovate. With Auth0 is simple to protect your API endpoints, manage your users, let them signup or login with one of the social connections, etc. But simple things are very difficult to make, and identity management is no exception. Unlike many in-house teams, we have dedicated a disproportionate amount of resources to make things secure, easy to use, extensible and scalable for developers, and delightful for end users. It‚Äôs really easy, I promise! Just try one of our Quickstarts, and let me know if you have any questions! Of course, it‚Äôs free to try, we offer a generous free plan (and great free open-source and discounted startup options!), and there‚Äôs a great community if you need help.\n\nSign Up here. Have I mentioned that it's free?\n\nMy job is to make sure things work smoothly for our customers. When they reach out for support, our support team takes care of investigation, analysis, troubleshooting, and ultimately providing a solution. The vast majority of issues are relatively easy to resolve, however, if there‚Äôs a bug on our end, or if we experience some sort of an outage, it‚Äôs on the developer support team to coordinate a response and make sure a fix is in place.",

So it‚Äôs absolutely fine to count decades in a human-friendly way, by tens.\nIn any event, in _my culture_, index count starts at zero. By _my culture_, I mean programming, of course :)\n\n\nIt‚Äôs hard to believe how much my life had changed in the past ten years. In February 2010, I was probably sitting in my apartment in Moscow, minding my own business, having dinner with family, or maybe a coffee with friends. 10 years later, I work in a completely different industry, I‚Äôm live in a different country on another continent, I‚Äôm 60 lbs heavier, 1 inch taller (!), and have 80% more gray hair. I also like to think that I‚Äôm much wiser than 10 years ago, but life has its on ways of proving me wrong on this again and again :)\nHere‚Äôs a quick look at the past decade and a look beyond 2020.\n\n2010\n\nRadio\n\nI started the decade as a radio personality. I was an editor of a few popular radio shows back Moscow. I also popped on air myself every now and again, and I mostly enjoyed it, and couldn‚Äôt really imagine myself doing anything else.\nHowever, by 2010 it was clear to me that my birth country is heading in a direction incompatible with my values. It‚Äôs been pretty clear for a while, and ever since 2006 my family was low key looking at our immigration options. In 2010 I came up with a plan, and started working on implementation.\n\nCanada\n\nIn fall 2010 I visited London, Ontario, Canada. I toured local schools, exploring programs I could take. At the time, Canada offered a pretty generous immigration path through education, and that was the plan.\n\nI‚Äôm eternally grateful to my friends in London for making this trip possible. This trip kicked-off the decade of adventure and change. After coming back home and discussing with the family, we came up with an action plan to move to Canada by fall 2011.\n\n2011\n\nFirst Immigration\n\nOn August 20, 2011 we left Russia with 3 suitcases and some carry-on, and 11 hours later landed in Toronto, Canada. Our wonderful friends drove us to London, our new home. Later that year I started Multimedia Design and Production program at Fanshawe. I‚Äôve been doing some tech stuff all my life, but this time it was official: I had proper programming classes and projects.\nThese were exciting times of discovering a new country, new way of life, new industry. We fell in love with Canada, Southwestern Ontario, Toronto, and everything around. These were challenging times too: we had very limited resources, no family around, school was challenging, overall adaptation to the new reality wasn‚Äôt always easy.\n\n2012\n\nOn May 1, 2012 my wife won a Diversity Visa (‚Äúgreen card lottery‚Äù), which granted us permanent residency in America. We considered it for a few hours, and chose to go through with the process and move to the United States. In December we got our visas, and landed as permanent residents on December 30, 2012 via Buffalo, NY.\n\nIn 2012 I also joined a small software project, which introduced me to software development and allowed to sustain the family for a few years.\n\n2013\n\nSecond Immigration\n\nWe stayed in Canada until I finished college, and moved to Vancouver, WA in May 2013. Initially, we were considering Grand Rapids, MI, but after a quick trip to Portland, OR, it became an obvious choice. We packed our apartment into a UBox, hopped on a plane and landed in PDX a few hours later. We‚Äôve been living in the Pacific Northwest ever since.\n\n2014\n\nWe started 2014 in Las Vegas on our Big California Trip. We flew in a single-engine airplane over Hoover Dam. I was a student pilot, recording over 50 hours of flight time, including a few amazing solo flights over the Cascades. We traveled a lot, exploring Oregon, Washington, Pacific Coast, the mountains, and everything this incredible region has to offer.\n\n2015\n\nIn 2015 we bought our first house and settled into our quite suburban life. Arguably, it was a bit too quite at times, so we traveled a lot and had some fun along the way. \n\nWe‚Äôve got our kittens, Trish and Dice!\n\nI also was performed my first solo flight as a pilot of a single engine airplane!\n\n2016\n\nThis was arguably one of the toughest years of the decade. A lot has changed, and we had to adapt to our new reality very quickly. I‚Äôd say we did a pretty good job.\n\nOne of the highlights of the years was our trip to the East Coast - DC & NY and spending 2 weeks with my parents there!\n\nIn December, I started working as a contractor at Intel. It was my first non-self-employment job in America.\n\n2017\n\n2017 was a year of most change since our last immigration.\n\nIn 2017 I became an uncle.\n\nIn 2017 We sold a house in Vancouver and moved to Seattle area.\n\nIn 2017 I started working as a contractor at AT&T.\n\nAs always, we traveled a lot.\n\nIn 2017 Chester Bennington of Linkin Park died of suicide. We had tickets to their show later that year, and it was difficult to contain our excitement about this upcoming concert.\n\nWe organized a memorial in Centennial Park in Seattle.\n\n2018\n\nThe year of Broken Leg. I broke my leg in February and this event defined pretty much the rest of the year.\n\nIn September, my contract with AT&T ended, and I picked up a 5-month project with a small company out of Kent.\n\nParents visited us in the fall, and it was one of the highlights of the year.\nFinally, this happened:\n\n2019\n\n2019 was a year of re-evaluating where I‚Äôm going and where I want to go. A year of being more true to myself than ever before. A year of strategic decisions and steps. The year of righting the wrongs, a year of self-care, inner peace and progress.\n\nIn May I picked up a 5-month project at Microsoft. It was a fun ride, I learned a lot an met some cool people. I believe that it paved the way for the next chapter of my life.\n\nIn December, after the most deliberate and exhaustive job hunt I‚Äôve ever performed, I [landed a job at Auth0](/blog/new-job/). It is as close to dream job as it gets, and I‚Äôve got pretty high hopes here :)\n\n2020 and beyond\n\nI enter this new decade with a lot of baggage that will require taking care of. Some things will be left behind for good, some will manifest themselves in unexpected ways. I will keep working on my mental health, family relationships, building new strong friendships and working on straightening old ones. A lot of work is ahead, and I‚Äôm hopeful and optimistic.\n\nHere‚Äôs to the new decade! Cheers! ü•Ç",

            "content_html": "It‚Äôs Saturday, and I‚Äôm at work. I worked last Saturday as well and will be working tomorrow too. I do this 100% voluntarily, because believe it or not, I enjoy my job. I don‚Äôt have to be here, I don‚Äôt have to come to the office every day or even most days, but I do nonetheless. Because I like it, it brings me joy, I have fun, I learn, my team is awesome, and I get free granola and coffee :)\n\nHowever, I‚Äôm old enough to realize that this sort of pace is not sustainable long-term. People get burnt out at the most fantastic dream jobs; their families suffer, friendships fall apart, even while their careers soar and they enjoy every moment of their work life. We all need breaks, even from the most fulfilling activities.\n\nSo‚Ä¶ Breaks, huh? Something to take your mind off work, daily tasks, goals, OKRs, KPIs, or what have you. People do all sorts of different things: they hike, they travel, read books at their favorite coffee shops, hang out with friends, watch TV, eat out, draw, make podcasts, brew beer, learn pottery, or how to fly an airplane. The list is endless, and most people find something enjoyable to do besides work.\n\nI‚Äôd most definitely go on an overnight solo hike this summer. I will absolutely fly a helicopter this summer at least once. It‚Äôs very likely that I‚Äôm going to visit friends in Portland in late July or August. I have a list of books I want to read, and I most certainly will.\n\nAs fun as they are, these activities are not of the ‚Äúall-consuming‚Äù kind. They are a bunch of events, not a continuous process. Even though you could fill your life with these activities, they are fleeting. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm embarking on this project I want to talk about.\n\nYou may or may not have heard about 750words.com. It‚Äôs a service that allows you to type 750 words a day. Any words, just let your thoughts flow. I loved it in the past, and still thinks it‚Äôs therapeutic value cannot be overestimated. Unfortunately, it hasn‚Äôt been updating recently, and I thought what if I make my own service of this kind? Hear me out.\n\nI want to build a service where I can vent, rant, or just let my thoughts flow freely. I want this service to help me understand where I am, how I actually feel, and be an outlet for my emotions. I also want this service to be an educational project, that would occupy me outside my work and provide new skills, entertainment, and something exciting to do.\n\nThe app I will be building will be focused on mental health, healthy coping mechanisms, gratitude, and self-care. To make it more fun, it will have all sorts of stats, graphs, and charts, sentiment analysis, badges, and more. I‚Äôm still defining requirements, so it‚Äôs all fluid.\n\nIn a nutshell, I‚Äôll be building a note-taking web application (React or Svelte) powered by serverless functions and a cloud database, and GraphQL. Notes will be encrypted at rest, and there will be a machine learning component for sentiment analysis. I‚Äôve got a bunch of extra point ideas (AI-generated background music for the file you type your notes, live stats, voice notes made with a mobile app automatically transcribed, and so on).\n\nI know very little about the technologies this project involves. I mean, I‚Äôve done at least a ‚Äúhello world‚Äù in all of them, but I don‚Äôt know enough to just sit down and build this all. So my objectives for this project are in no particular order:\n\nLearn the tech\n\nGet my mind off work for an interesting project\n\nBuild an app from zero to hero\n\nGet a service I‚Äôd like to use\n\nHopefully, involve other people and grow together with them\n\nAt this time, I‚Äôve only set up a repository and filling its project section. So it‚Äôs very early, and if you‚Äôre looking for something fun to learn in 2020, chime in, and let‚Äôs do it together. There‚Äôs absolutely no pressure behind this project, no monetization concerns, no marketing or building a user base. Just learning, building, exploring, and helpful service at the end.\n\nHit me up on Github if you think it‚Äôs something you‚Äôd like to be a part of. All skills are welcome (from design to devops), all levels are welcome (from total newbies to enlightened seniors). I guarantee a 100% inclusive, safe, and friendly learning and building environment.

Whenever we work on weekends, we can then take a day off during the week. Well, today was the day, and I forgot about it.\n\nI‚Äôm not entirely sure what it means. Probably, that I‚Äôm less organized than I thought previously, or maybe I still don‚Äôt think about my work as a joby-job; I come to work, we hang out tackling things and battling all sorts of uncertainties, figure out stuff together and on our own, recreate apps, reproduce bugs, troubleshoot the unknown, stretch (!), drink coffee and go back home whenever we feel like it to keep doing all these things remotely.

I don‚Äôt want to reconcile what I enjoy passionately with what I do for work, or with who I am. I am all the things I love and all the things I do and say.

            "content_html": "I started this year with a resolution, that I will upgrade my job, and will not compromise on anything in the process.\n\nWell‚Ä¶\n\nMy first contact of 2019 finished in late March. By late April, I had two offers: a web dev contract with AT&T (boring, questionable work environment, rather short, but quite lucrative pay) and Microsoft (a lot of creative freedom, challenging project, access to some of the smartest engineers in the world, almost certain extension, ok-ish pay). I went with Microsoft as it seemed to be a more interesting project even if it didn‚Äôt pay too well. I learned a ton, met many incredible people, got extended, learned some more, shipped, and delivered. By early October, I was back on the job market, and let me tell, I was quite salty. Year-end is in sight, I‚Äôve got some great new experience under my belt, but no cigar: where‚Äôs my job upgrade, damn it?!\n\nSo I‚Äôve designed my new job hunt very precisely. Here‚Äôs what I did differently:\n\nI stopped sourcing positions from trash sites (ZipRecruiter, Indeed, Monster, and a pile of others). They are infested with third- and fourth-party recruiters, staffing and temp agencies, scammers, and other leeches of this kind.\n\nI started tracking my activities very carefully, methodically recording where I sourced a position from, how and when I applied, what‚Äôs the status, what‚Äôs the interview stage, etc. I now have a list of companies I will never consider again: those who didn‚Äôt have the decency to send an automated rejection and just ghosted me.\n\nI sourced my positions almost exclusively from Glassdoor and LinkedIn (to a much lesser extent), and directly by searching for local tech companies with great reviews or great backstories (and exceptional hiring practices)\n\nI only applied to companies I truly wanted to work at. Not ‚Äúif the pay is great‚Äù, not ‚Äúwell, if I can work from home three times a week‚Äù, none of this. Just ‚ÄúYep, that‚Äôs my place, and these are my people, and we‚Äôll figure out the rest‚Äù. I was fortunate to be in the position to spend a few months just looking for a perfect fit, and not taking any job just because I needed a job ASAP.\n\nI spent 10+ hours most days crafting cover letters, tweaking my resume, researching companies in-depth, applying, answering emails, setting up calls, taking phone interviews, going to onsite interviews, doing take-home assignments. It was intense, draining, but so much fun!\n\nNot even once did I attempt to please the interviewer or guess and offer answers I knew they were looking for; I was 100% my authentic self and gave exactly zero fucks about the usual hiring dance. ‚ÄúWhere do I see myself in 5 years, you ask? Hopefully, on a beach with a mojito. Next question.‚Äù It was so liberating and so rewarding. I even got to wear my ‚ÄúTask failed successfully‚Äù t-shirt to one of the interviews just because I felt like it (and ended up getting an offer from them)\n\nBeing relaxed, authentic, and confident in my decision to never compromise on anything important to me, gave me this incredibly powerful feeling of being in control of the process, and not at the mercy of the job market.\n\nIn the end, I applied to 2x fewer positions than in the spring round and got 2.5x more offers in the same time-frame, all of which were permanent, full-time positions at companies I‚Äôd be happy to work for.\n\nI ended up with 5 offers, 4 of which were within my range (and the 5th one could probably be negotiated to get within the range), with a variety of benefit options, different flexibility levels, and a variety of career paths.\n\nNow, with 4 offers in hand (and one coming in later), I had a tough task of making the right choice. Do I go for more money but less flexibility? Or a better work environment, but an unclear career path? Stock options or flexible paid time off? Well, I was set to not compromise on anything important, so‚Ä¶ Flexible schedule, flexible (as in ‚Äúunlimited‚Äù) paid time off, good 401(k) match, stock options, clear career path, challenging tasks, awesome team. All or nothing. And at this point, it was pretty easy to choose. Introducing Auth0.\n\nProcess\n\nThe interview process took about 5 weeks from the day I applied to accept the offer. It consisted of an initial phone screen, an interview with my potential manager, another one with my potential teammates, a take-home assignment, and finally a call with one of the senior directors. There‚Äôs a great post about how exactly Auth0 hires engineers.\n\nHow We Hire Engineers\n\nThe initial screen was nothing surprising, except for a sense of transparency and genuine interest in my experience and personality.\n\nSecond call‚Ä¶ I blew it, big time :) It was set up as a Zoom meeting, and for some reason, I thought that I should expect a call, while in fact, I was supposed to call in myself. Anyway, the call was rescheduled and went well over an hour, and generally was just a friendly chat about me, my experience, job expectations, the company, position, team, management, and such. It went well, and the next step was set up.\n\nThe next call went equally well, and it was a great chance to get a better feel of the teammates, what they do, and who they are. Again, it resembled a friendly conversation more than an interview. Take-home assignment, coming up next!\n\nThen, a take-home assignment was set up. It was a pretty interesting experience. I got invited to a Slack channel, where I was to work with one of my potential co-workers on a task that might come up in my day-to-day job (I had to write an app using Auth0 docs and APIs). All expectations were set very clear and upfront, no guessing required: what they were looking at in the process and in the end result, how my performance will be evaluated, what success looks like, what to be aware of, and so on. I was traveling at the moment and submitted the app almost a week later.\n\nA few days after that, I got a message that the team was impressed with my app, enough to move me to the next and final stage. A call with a senior director of my potential department was set up a couple of days later, it went well. The next day I was offered the job, which I accepted.\n\nI started on December 9th as a Developer Support Engineer with a group of 26 newly hired colleagues from engineering, marketing, sales, administration, from all over the world. It was the first time we visited the Auth0 office. A week of intense onboarding resembled a nerdy summer camp rather than corporate orientation. It was fun :)\n\nAuth0 is a remote-friendly company, and the whole interview process is organized 100% online. When 60% of the company doesn‚Äôt work in the office, and the team is spread across all timezones in 35 different countries, online-first is the only approach here that makes sense. Still, for onboarding, Auth0 brings new people to Bellevue HQ.\n\nIt will take me some time to write about the onboarding experience and my first weeks at Auth0, but let me just say that it‚Äôs everything I‚Äôve been wishing for and then some. Stay tuned!\n\nOh, you‚Äôre still here? Ok.¬†We are hiring right now!¬†Hit me up for a referral, see our¬†Careers¬†page, and follow us on¬†LinkedIn! Here‚Äôs¬†how we hire engineers¬†(and we hire from all sorts of¬†non-traditional backgrounds), and here‚Äôs what we value.\n\nAlso, we give a shit.",

            "content_html": "In 2005, I bought my first Mac mini. It had 1.25 Ghz G3 processor, like, 256 Mb of RAM, and a 40 Gb HDD. At the moment, it was the most exciting device I‚Äôve ever owned. Mac OS X was such a blow of fresh air after Windows XP! It was well-designed, friendly, relatively fast, quiet. It had all the apps I wanted to use, and since I‚Äôve never been a gamer, lack of gaming titles didn‚Äôt bother me at all. I was in love with Apple. In the years since, I owned a bunch of Macbooks, a couple of iMacs, all kinds of iPhones, iPads, and a pair of Apple Watches. My family is a full Apple house.\n\nApple of 2005 is not the same company like Apple in 2019. I‚Äôm not going to get into everything that makes Apple of 2019 into a Microsoft of 2005, and it‚Äôs not fair to compare them one to one, still, I‚Äôm convinced that these two have way more in common these days then they are different. Anyway, I‚Äôm not here to start another holy war, I‚Äôm just documenting my journey.\n\nReasons\n\nI‚Äôve been thinking about leaving the Apple ecosystem for a while now. Apple has been slow to innovate or even uphold any level of quality of their laptops. In late 2016 I bought the latest and presumably the greatest MacBook Pro with TouchBar, and I had never been so disappointed in any Apple product, and possibly, in any piece of technology in a very long while. TouchBar is an unusable gimmick that replaced perfectly good function keys. The butterfly keyboard is by far, the very worst keyboard I‚Äôve ever seen or used in my entire life (not to mention that I had to replace it twice because it‚Äôs constantly breaking due to its poor design). The computer is slow as heck (my bad, I could only afford 8 gigs of RAM), holds the charge for like 2 hours of light web browsing, tops, only has these stupid USB-C ports, doesn‚Äôt have an SD-card reader, has a relatively meh screen by today standards, no graphic card to speak of, and doesn‚Äôt support touch. Its operating system and applications are stale at best, and the day when Apple prevents any non-Apple-App-Store software from running on their laptops is closer than you think. You can service literally zero components of a computer that you (presumably) own.\n\nNow that I‚Äôve got it out of my system, let‚Äôs get to the real reason: Apple is boring as hell. I remember when they were at the forefront of things, now they are just a fashion brand of mediocre tech and status quo. All interesting things in the tech industry are happening elsewhere, and it‚Äôs been like this for a while now.\n\nI want an adventure. I want new stuff. I want the cutting edge. I want round pegs in the square holes. I want to be with the misfits, the crazy ones. With the ones who see things differently.\n\nThe Plan\n\nTo this day, I haven‚Äôt had any serious day-to-day experience with Linux. I use Windows 10 at work, and it‚Äôs a pretty ok system, but it‚Äôs not something I want to deal with in my personal life for a variety of reasons (from the fact that direction may and will change, and you have no input, to the fact that you get system ‚Äúas is‚Äù, and it always be like that.)\n\nThe only alternative I know to Windows and Mac OS is Linux in all its flavors (don‚Äôt get me started saying that there‚Äôs also ChromeOS. Not only it‚Äôs Linux-based, it‚Äôs quite a joke, tbh). So my plan was simple: try some Linuxes (or is it Linuxi?), make sure they meet my needs, gradually transition my work to Linux, and finally migrate to some decent hardware as well. This is a sensible thing to do, a smooth and straightforward plan. So, yeah. I did none of this in this order. What I did, I outright bought a performance laptop, slapped Ubuntu on it, and haven‚Äôt opened my MacBook for a week. This is how real crazy ones explore new things, amirite?\n\nThe Process\n\nHere‚Äôs how it went. I‚Äôve been reading about different branches of Linux, different flavors, desktop environments, and all things in between. I watch countless hours of Youtube reviews of different hardware, how it plays with different software, what works, what doesn‚Äôt, how things are done, what they look like, what gets the Linux people excited, and so forth. It actually took me down the rabbit hole of open-source software, decentralization, privacy, and other things, so much so that I‚Äôve completely left mainstream social networks for Mastodon. But this is a whole different story - a story of me suddenly realizing that I‚Äôve been doing my digital hygiene and social media all wrong this whole time.\n\nAnywho. Selecting a distro is like whoa?! üò≤ There're hundreds if not thousands of them, most of them are so much alike, but some are so very different. Some have an underlying philosophy that drives the whole thing, some just have a cuter set of icons and a friendlier setup guide.\n\nSo how do I choose? Should I try Debian? After all, it runs on my home server. Or maybe, Ubuntu? I‚Äôve tried it a few times in the past, and it runs on all my Digital Ocean instances. Maybe, Arch? It‚Äôs so customizable, they said. Manjaro, the friendly Arch? Fedora? CentOS? Mint? KDE Neon? OpenSUSE?\n\nI‚Äôve got them all!\n\nAnd what about desktop environments? They are, again, so alike, yet so different. GNOME looks ok, but KDE people tend to bash it a lot, and Plasma 5 indeed looks amazing. Perhaps, Cinnamon? Bungie? MATE? Maybe, Xfce? Pantheon? Deepin?\n\nAnd what about hardware? Do NVidia cards work with Linux or do they not? Or is it the integrated Intel stuff that doesn‚Äôt work (or does it work?) What about HiDPI screens? Touch? External audio interfaces?\n\nSo here‚Äôs what I learned. Literally, none of this matters. When you‚Äôre just starting out, just go with the largest community, most available information, and just start somewhere. As far as hardware goes, Linux is at the point where it doesn‚Äôt matter what hardware you have, it will almost certainly support it. Worst case scenario, you‚Äôd need to type a few things into a command line, and maybe reboot.\n\nStatus\n\nRight now, I‚Äôm on a top-notch Dell XPS 15, 32 Gb of RAM, 1 TB of fast SSD and an Ubuntu. It‚Äôs been fantastic so far. I enjoy tinkering with the system, tweaking every little thing to my liking, although arguably GNOME doesn‚Äôt bend as far as KDE does. I‚Äôve installed all the apps I need, including Steam, and with NVidia card on (I can turn it on and off at will), games look fantastic on this incredible HiDPI OLED touchscreen. I do venture into other live distros that I store on an SD card (yep, I‚Äôve got an SD card reader here! Screw you, Apple!) It‚Äôs been almost 5 hours since I‚Äôve unplugged the charger; I‚Äôve been coding a bit, watching videos, listening to music in the background (and switching between tracks with predictable function keys), and writing this post on this great keyboard. Battery holds at 40%, and I haven‚Äôt really done any serious optimizations yet (although I plan to; I want to see if I can make this baby run for 10 hours on a single charge while I‚Äôm doing some meaningful work.)\n\nAre there quirks? Oh, hell yes. For starters, I‚Äôve got a really new Killer Wifi card here, and apparently, it hasn‚Äôt made its way into the kernel yet. So I had indeed struggled for a few minutes until I found a step-by-step (with 2 steps, really) tutorial on how to add this specific card driver to my system. It will, of course, be included in the fall system update. Aside from that, some weirdness is going on with some VS Code shortcuts (they are supposed to work, but they don‚Äôt, specifically Shift+Alt+Up/Down); email clients are trash (not that I use them anyway, but still), Firefox is surprisingly unstable (it crashes whenever another app tries to open a browser window) (UPD: Mozilla has already fixed this along with other minor annoyances.) There are tricky issues with .NET (it installs, runs, and builds just fine, but some weirdness is going on with serving server responses and SSL, not sure yet). Overall visual language in GNOME is outdated, even though I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs meh bordering with ok. As for the laptop itself, speakers are narrowly passable at best. Oh, and the fingerprint scanner doesn‚Äôt work, and on the first try, the external monitor didn‚Äôt connect right away (pending investigation). HiDPI screen is also quirky in that scaling is basically 100%, 200%, or 300%, and some apps get confused (although, I‚Äôve already seen Nextcloud fix it before my eyes: 2 days ago it was confusing, now it‚Äôs all good). Notifications in GNOME are useless since you can‚Äôt really really read the third line (and if click as to expand, they just clear up). I bet I‚Äôll think of something else before next weekend.\n\nWhat‚Äôs next\n\nGlad you asked! Next, I‚Äôm staying here for as long as this laptop lasts. With these specs, this solid quality build, and this level of future-proofing and serviceability (oh yeah, I can replace the SSD with a bigger one eventually; memory is topped out, though, but the battery is replaceable and serviceable as well) it could last me for 10 years. Sure, it‚Äôs still very early, but I‚Äôm so very happy with this move, I can‚Äôt even. So, will see.\n\nAs a side note here, I‚Äôm researching GNOME themes. I mean, out of dozens and dozens that I‚Äôve seen, literally, none are good. I‚Äôm on Arc-Darker now, and I can stand it, but I‚Äôm looking into building my own theme. I‚Äôve heard they are CSS-based ;)",

            "content_html": "I‚Äôve been cleaning up my digital life for the past couple of months. The deeply underlying reasons are not important (let‚Äôs just say, it‚Äôs all a part of a bigger self-care and mental health regimen), so I‚Äôll go with the more on the surface ones here.\n\n<tin-hat>\n\nSocial Media\n\nFor me, social media was a way to socialize since its inception. I‚Äôve got my invite into LiveJournal in 2003 and have been on social media ever since. I‚Äôve moved to Facebook, and to Twitter, and to Instagram, I tried new sites as they popped up into existence only to disappear forever just a few years later. After I left my country of birth, social media became a way to keep up with friends and family. It all changed over time into a feeding tube, a constant fire hose of text, images, status updates, new, and, sure, ads. Scandal after scandal, these companies were getting away with everything, from storing and leaking plain-text passwords to breaking a democracy. I got so fed up with this, that over a year ago I made my first attempt to quit (announcement in Russian). I‚Äôve made a few strategic mistakes, and my experiment didn‚Äôt stick for too long; I think, I was back on Facebook within 2 weeks. This time it‚Äôs different. This time, I‚Äôm truly ready, and I have all the things and attitudes I need to never look back.\n\nLife after mainstream social media\n\nIt‚Äôs really a huge privilege to be able to just quit Facebook. For so many people around the world, Facebook is the internet, and quitting it is just not an option. For me, luckily, it‚Äôs very much an option. I‚Äôm missing out, of course, since everyone and their grandmother is on Facebook, sharing baby pictures and concert invites, but my wife keeps me in the loop of truly important things and you know what? I‚Äôm still available! You have to be deliberate as in explicitly share things with that you think I might be interested in. I know, it‚Äôs hard to believe, but that‚Äôs how things used to be: you have friends and you don‚Äôt just make radio announcements whenever you find something you want to share with them. You‚Äôd call, text, talk to them over a coffee, send them a post pigeon or roll in a clay plate. Whatever you do, you‚Äôre deliberate in your communications and relationships.\n\nAnd you know what? It appears to be a good filter (well, still not sure if it‚Äôs good or bad, but it‚Äôs a filter). I used to struggle with guilt over the fact that I‚Äôm not connecting with people enough; I don‚Äôt call or text my friends that much, but hey, phones work both ways. If I don‚Äôt call or text you and therefore we lose connection, you weren‚Äôt calling me either. So was it ever a meaningful thing to begin with?..\n\nAlternatives\n\nIn the world of total Facebook dominance, it‚Äôs surprising that alternatives even exist. One of them, Mastodon, I‚Äôve heard about before. I even tried it a few years back, but never got ahold of it: what are all these instances, how do the interact, the hell is fediverse, how do you build your life here?‚Ä¶ Well, re-discovering Mastodon was for me like discovering this whole new internet. Small, friendly, open, weird in so many ways, but so much aligned with my values. Apparently, open source is huge, people build free software just for the hell of it, and it‚Äôs so easy to join them! They discuss big ideas, and how next year is going to be the year of Linux :)) There‚Äôs a ton of Youtube channels, podcasts, news sites and magazines (!) in this space. Art and artists are really big, people are not trying to pretend to be someone else, and big brands haven‚Äôt noticed any of this yet. You‚Äôre not being tracked (not even a Google Analytics tracker!), there are no ads of any kind, you own all of your data, you can take it with you at any time, delete your account instantly, and erase any trace of you ever being on the server. One dude decided that Instagram needs an open source alternative, and he‚Äôs been building it for a year at astonishing pace and fantastic results. Oh, and it federates with the rest of ActivityPub instances. I will write a Mastodon explainer eventually, since I sooo dig it now.\n\nBut what about this digital hygiene thing?\n\nWhat about it? :) My mind is clearer, I‚Äôm not constantly scrolling through countless ads, I‚Äôm not anxious to click on a link since I know it won‚Äôt follow me for the rest of my online life (I also use Firefox with Facebook container enabled to prevent not only regular trackers, but to block Facebook specifically from tracking me around the web). I‚Äôm not reading the news other then what comes as Breaking News alerts from the Washington Post. I discovered so many incredible people and ideas, I‚Äôm so very excited about this newly discovered little internet! I‚Äôm not refreshing Twitter before going to sleep, and I don‚Äôt check my Instagram first thing in the morning (I deleted both apps from my phone long ago). I live a more mindful and meaningful life in so many ways, I‚Äôm not sure I know how to express it. It‚Äôs just so much easier to do all this when you‚Äôre off the grid of FB and such. And aside from it all, I‚Äôm learning a lot. About people, about their perspectives, about software, hacking, about all sorts of things. Am I missing out on some action happening on Facebook and Twitter and elsewhere? Sure. Do I care? Nope, not anymore.\n\nNotes\n\nPer law, Facebook and other mainstream social media companies must do whatever they choose with whatever data they gather from you while you are in any way engaged with their services (unless you‚Äôre in Europe) to increase shareholders‚Äô profits. They owe you nothing, and they have no obligation to please you or to make you feel safe. They will implement all sorts of¬†dark patterns¬†to make you engaged with their service and to help you give up as much data points about yourself as humanly possible.\n\nYou, per law, have the right to give up and give away, knowingly or not, to any web or offline service or person any and all of your personal information without any limits. You are 100% responsible for how these services use your personal and other information. Because they are not responsible for anything whatsoever (again, unless you‚Äôre in Europe). You also have a right to deny access to any of your data to any of these companies and not use their services if you‚Äôre uncomfortable with their business practices.\n\n</tin-hat>",

            "content_html": "It‚Äôs been a few weeks since I‚Äôd been woken up in the middle of the night by an earthquake. I just want to write this down since this was one of my first encounters with this natural phenomenon. I think I‚Äôve been through a light earthquake when I was visiting California in 1996, but I can‚Äôt be sure, and I couldn‚Äôt find any archival information (it was sometime in August 1996, somewhere either in Sacramento or in the LA area).\n\nI was born and lived most of my life in the middle of the Eurasian tectonic plate. Just to make it clear: it‚Äôs a very, very stable, very thick, and super solid tectonic plate. And when you‚Äôre in the middle of it, there‚Äôs no possibility of an earthquake happening, practically ever. You get some tremors from distant earthquakes every now and then, but they are in the imperceptible range of magnitude 1-2.\n\nAfter moving to Pacific Northwest in 2013, earthquakes suddenly became a real possibility. For the first five years in Cascades foothills along the Columbia River gorge, I was closely following seismic activities around us. With Mt. St. Helens visible from almost everywhere in Vancouver, WA, and Mt. Hood looming practically wherever you are, volcanos, eruptions, and earthquakes were always on my radar. I‚Äôd read about swarm quakes around one of the nearby volcanoes, or somewhere along the coast. Then I‚Äôd read that we had an earthquake last night somewhere real close (as in 20-30 miles), but it was, say, magnitude 2.5.\n\nYears passed, and earthquakes were replaced on my radar by more pressing issues (work, family, school, and such). We moved north to the Seattle area, and since mountains here are somewhat further away from our house than they were in Vancouver, and since the closest volcano, Mt. Rainier, is pretty far away, it all kinda faded away. I mean, I understand that nothing changed really; if anything, we are in a more tremor-prone are now with Juan de Fuca plate, and multiple faults right underneath our house, but it all somehow got less real, I guess‚Ä¶\n\nAnd then you wake up at 2:51 am on a Friday night because your bed is shaking pretty violently, and the whole house is rattling and creaking for a whole 5-10 seconds.\n\nApparently, this is the third strongest earthquake in Washington in the last 10 years, two others being M4.9 in Poulsbo in 2009, and M4.7 near Okanagan in 2011. This one hit only 7 miles from home, in Monroe (I‚Äôm in Mill Creek), about 1 hour northeast of Seattle.\n\nAt first, I thought a truck hit our house. We have a pretty quiet straight street passing by the house, and at night people do not really obey the 35 mph speed limit. They speed by, and at least on two occasions in the past 2 years, these racers hit parked cars on the street. So, my first assumption when my house started shaking and making noises at night - someone hit the house with their car!\n\nBut then it went all quiet. Wife woke up, looked at the time on her phone, and went back to sleep (she later admitted that she didn‚Äôt understand why she randomly woke up in the middle of the night, and angrily went back to sleep as in like, what the hell, why am I awake?!). Neighbors across the yard turned their patio lights, all was quiet, but felt off. A few minutes later, another shake, much shorter (like, maybe a 2-3 seconds), but as noticeable. By this time, I realized what‚Äôs going on, got up, met our completely freaked out cats just outside our bedroom, checked on my son (he didn‚Äôt wake up), and checked Twitter:\n\nI never felt an earthquake before (at least, I can‚Äôt remember it), and this was a jolt of an experience. We don‚Äôt have any food or water for emergencies! I have no idea what to do in an earthquake (run? go outside? crawl under the bed??). So I spent the rest of the night reading through all the news about all the local earthquakes, preparedness blogs, and so on. I‚Äôm still not prepared, but I‚Äôm on track!\n\nAnyway, my point is, every now and then, a theory you‚Äôve known all along becomes reality. Get ready and be prepared!",

            "content_html": "It baffles me to say this out loud, but for the last month, I‚Äôve been working at Microsoft. I‚Äôve been building a proof-of-concept for an internal client search application and an interface for it. It‚Äôs been a journey, that‚Äôs for sure. From getting proper access and setting things up in general to acquiring specific permissions to databases, figuring out hosting and deployment with Azure, solving AAD authentication issues and burning the midnight oil when some stupid bug prevented the app from running.\n\nI‚Äôm not writing or talking much about any of this: I‚Äôve got a severe case of imposter syndrome called imposter paralysis, and it feels like everything I‚Äôve been doing as a developer so far is some sort of shenanigans that I‚Äôve managed to pull off somehow. Every morning when I get to work I think to myself that today is the day I get discovered. And every time on my long commute back home I‚Äôm surprised if not perplexed by the fact that no catastrophe unraveled. Moreover, I‚Äôd made some good progress, fixed a few blocking issues I had no clue how to approach earlier this morning, and that I‚Äôm clearly on track to demo the app on time at the end of my contract in late June.\n\nThis weird situation, this mental limbo, got me thinking. What if I‚Äôm not, in fact, an imposter? What if my skill is not completely made up? What if I am, for all intents and purposes, a programmer? Come to think of it, I‚Äôm writing programs. I‚Äôm building applications. However simple or boring they might be, they solve clients‚Äô problems and deliver exactly what they asked for, on time. I write code and some smart people are happy to pay me for it, so long as it does what it‚Äôs supposed to do.\n\nBut when I say ‚ÄúI‚Äôm coding‚Äù what I really mean is I stumble upon something I don‚Äôt know or can‚Äôt remember how to do, google it, google it some more, google the shit out of it, try a dozen different ways to get where I need to be, figure things out after all, and fist-pump when it all starts to click. In my mind, however, real programmers just code: they know what to type into their IDE right away, with all the syntax, patterns, and algorithms at the tip of their fingers, ready to go.\n\nOne thing I found very helpful and empowering is watching other people code. I‚Äôm not talking about nicely edited tutorials and polished explainer videos, but about people just turning on their screen capture software and a webcam, and streaming whatever happens. Apparently, other people google too, and make silly mistakes, and do weird stuff for seemingly no reason, and squash them pesky bugs, and refer to StackOverflow, and so much more! Watching people live code was an eye-opener and a thrill! Not the nail-biting kind of thrill, but the kind where you‚Äôre thrilled to see people make mistakes, get frustrated, answer questions, get confused by their own code, but figure it out more often than not. And most of the videos I‚Äôve seen have this theme in them: this kind of stuff helps you get better at coding and overcome imposter syndrome.\n\nSo, with extreme anxiety bordering on full-on panic, I announce that I will be live-streaming some of my coding sessions on¬†Twitch. Please, follow, subscribe, and join in. I will be talking a lot, google even more, and use StackOverflow obsessively. It‚Äôs also going to be ‚Äúif you see something, say something‚Äù situation, so when you see me doing something completely idiotic and totally stupid, please, let me know.\n\nI, obviously, haven‚Äôt made it as a developer; I occasionally struggle to find work, and I struggle even more to land a truly good job (not because I‚Äôm picky, mind you). So this is not a ‚Äúlooking back to my early days‚Äù kind of story. I realize that this post might (and most likely will) bite me from the job search standpoint (who wants to hire an imposter?!), but I feel very strongly that unless I get over this whole imposter paralysis situation, I myself will keep hurting my own job search success even more. I don‚Äôt expect my stream to be of educational value to anyone but myself; I do, however, hope that it will help at least one person realize that you don‚Äôt have to know everything in order to code, that coding is sometimes messy, and you make mistakes, and you search for answers, and none of the above makes you less of a developer.\n\nP.S. There‚Äôs a group of people here, who know and remember me from my previous life as a radio host and a rather public person. They listen to my monthly podcast and follow me elsewhere, and they know I‚Äôm good at speaking, not coding. Some of them were supportive and encouraging of my career switch a few years back, yet some are very protective when it comes to who is and who isn‚Äôt a real programmer. To all of you I say thank you for your feedback, but this is my life now, and I need you on board.",

            "content_html": "It‚Äôs hard to believe, but I‚Äôve been listening to podcasts for almost 15 years, and been podcasting myself since April 2006. Just think about it: back then Youtube had just pivoted from being a dating site, Twitter had like 150 active users, Uber won‚Äôt exist for another 3 years or so, and the most innovative mobile phone companies in the world are Nokia and Blackberry. Blockbuster was huge, and Lost was the biggest TV show of all time, still in Season 3 :)\n\nPodcasting never took off the way video streaming did, but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs an issue. Spoken word historically loses to moving pictures in popularity, but more often than not wins in substance and depth. Not only this, but podcasts do not require the same level of focus and concentration as does, say, Youtube. You can‚Äôt really drive and watch Kurzgesagt, but you can drive and listen to Science Vs.\n\nHere‚Äôs a list of my favorite podcasts. Some of them are in their second decade of running, some are pretty new, but all of them are a tremendous source of knowledge, news, and human experience as it relates to hitech industry in general, and software development in particular. Feel free to make a pull request if you think I‚Äôve missed a great show here!\n\nTL;DR¬†You can¬†download a complete OPML list of all 30 shows¬†mentioned below. Just feed it to your favorite podcast app (I suggest¬†Overcast) and have all these shows in you subscriptions right away!\n\nDev\n\nDev podcasts provide a great deal of information and an amazing learning experience. They also give a greater sense of community and feeling of belonging. Below is a list of podcasts that deal directly with software and web development.\n\n1.¬†Syntax‚Äã\n\nRelatively new and a real hit. Two hosts, Wes ‚ÄúBarracuda‚Äù Bos & Scott ‚ÄúEl Toro Loco‚Äù Tolinski, normally make JavaScript courses and speak at conferences, but every now and then (more like a few times a week) they get together and talk shop. From general things like how do you advance as a freelancer or get your first dev job to the newest CSS tricks and sick latest internalization features. ‚ÄúPotluck‚Äù Q&A episodes and pinpoint ‚ÄúTasty Treats‚Äù.\n\nSyntax iTunes | Syntax RSS‚Äã\n\n2.¬†React Podcast‚Äã\n\nIt‚Äôs all in the name. From interviews with core React team members to vision and in-depth specifics of the framework we all love (and we do love it!) to career discussions.\n\nReact Podcast iTunes | React Podcast RSS‚Äã\n\n3.¬†Software Engineering Daily‚Äã\n\nA broad look on basically all things software dev. This one is not specific to web development, though. To be honest, I don‚Äôt have that much time, and I do have a lot of other good podcasts to listen to, so personally, I skim shownotes of new episodes and listen to those that look promising. Interesting topics come up more often then not, but time is a finite resource, unfortunately.\n\nSoftware Engineering Daily iTunes | Software Engineering Daily RSS‚Äã\n\n4.¬†The Changelog‚Äã\n\nThe Changelog has been around for quite some time now. Episodes feature prominent engineers, developers, and other experts, and usually have a specific topic.\n\nThe Changelog iTunes | The Changelog RSS‚Äã\n\n5.¬†JS Party‚Äã\n\nüéâüéâüéâ Fun and casual, the kind of chat you‚Äôd like to be a part of. As serious as some topics are (burnout, anyone?), episodes are mostly on inspiring and empowering side.\n\nJS Party iTunes | JS Party RSS‚Äã\n\n6.¬†Developer Tea‚Äã\n\nDeveloper Tea is on a shorter, bite-size side of podcasting. Inspiring and useful to both newbies and seasoned developers, and available to anyone with a 20+ minute commute. I even trained my Alexa to give me new Developer Tea in the morning, and most days their episodes fit nicely into my breakfast routine.\n\nDeveloper Tea iTunes | Developer Tea RSS‚Äã\n\n7.¬†Full Stack Radio‚Äã\n\nWeekly in-depth interview show with Adam Wathan. Sometimes I listen to the guests and wonder if I‚Äôd ever have such an enormous understanding of tech as they do.\n\nFull Stack Radio iTunes | Full Stack Radio RSS‚Äã\n\n8.¬†Shop Talk‚Äã\n\nAnother great show about frontend development, web design and all things UX. It‚Äôs interesting how sometimes you here the same guests on different podcasts from this list, but every host and every show has a different angle and offers a different conversation. Exciting guests, great in-depth conversations.\n\nShop Talk iTunes | Shop Talk RSS‚Äã\n\n9.¬†FreeCodeCamp‚Äã\n\nFreeCodeCamp is one of the absolutely best and completely free and open-source resources for learning software development. It‚Äôs been growing like crazy, has incredible community of passionate people who are happy to share their knowledge and help out the newbies. Their podcast is no exception: awesome guests, stimulating topics, success stories and so much more. Highly recommended!\n\nFreeCodeCamp iTunes | FreeCodeCamp RSS‚Äã\n\n10.¬†Second Career Devs‚Äã\n\nKyle talks with people who became software engineers after they had a previous career in other fields. This one is particularly dear to me since I‚Äôve been a journalist and a radio host in my previous life, and can very much relate as being a second career developer myself.\n\nSecond Career Devs iTunes | Second Career Devs RSS‚Äã\n\n11.¬†Maintainable‚Äã\n\nLegacy code, technical debt, and how to maintain and advance older projects (personal or at work). This one is tailored more towards seasoned developers audience, but anyone could benefit regardless of current experience level.\n\nMaintainable iTunes | Maintainable RSS‚Äã\n\n12.¬†CodePen Radio‚Äã\n\nCodePen is an awesome tool to quickly prototype a feature, showcase some code, do an exercise or collaborate on a project. They run an insightful podcast about, well, running a web software business.\n\nCodePen Radio iTunes | CodePen Radio RSS‚Äã\n\n13.¬†Coding Blocks‚Äã\n\nPodcast about computer programming and software development so you can learn on the go.\n\nIndeed. Topics vary greatly, but you‚Äôll find yourself diving deep into different programming concepts and learning a whole lot of new stuff every month.\n\nCoding Blocks iTunes | Coding Blocks RSS‚Äã\n\nGeneral Tech Talk\n\nMore on the general side, these podcasts cover tech news. Some of them go in-depth with philosophical implications of tech stories, some deal with particulars of working in tech.\n\n14.¬†This Week in Tech‚Äã\n\nLeo Laporte is a true legend and one of the pioneers of podcasting. His TWiTnetwork runs a whole bunch of shows, from Cyber Security to iOS to daily tech news. I consider This Week in Tech to be the weekly tech news podcast.\n\nP.S. I‚Äôve met with Leo once a while back, it was fun :)\n\nThis Week in Tech iTunes | This Week in Tech RSS‚Äã\n\n15.¬†Accidental Tech Podcast‚Äã\n\nMarco Arment, Casey Liss, and John Siracusa, a trio of well-known software developers, writers and producers, run this very special show. It‚Äôs both sarcastic, and optimistic, and all-doom-and-gloom at times, but then it‚Äôs something else completely. It‚Äôs all over the place in the best sense possible. It is quite heavily Apple-leaning, since hosts been covering Apple or working with Apple stack for decades. Marco Arment, for instance, is the person responsible for Overcast, without a doubt the best podcast app out there.\n\nAccidental iTunes | Accidental RSS‚Äã\n\n16.¬†Indie Hackers‚Äã\n\nI couldn‚Äôt skip Indie Hackers, although this is probably one of the podcasts that I‚Äôm not entirely sure I like :) Sometimes it‚Äôs a lot of hype, and guests are this self-made kind of know-it-alls, but then they strike gold with a meaningful, inspiring, and overall great conversation with someone who‚Äôs humble because they truly know their stuff. Hit and miss, in short, but still worth a sub.\n\nIndie Hackers iTunes | Indie Hackers RSS‚Äã\n\nApple & Mac\n\nAs we all know, Apple invented podcasts. To exactly no one‚Äôs surprise, Apple is heavily covered by dozens of different shows. The company is beloved by some, and despised by others, but I really don‚Äôt know a single person who‚Äôs completely indifferent towards Apple.\n\n17.¬†MacBreak Weekly‚Äã\n\nThis is the oldest Mac and Apple show in existence; I remember watching one of the first ever HD videos I‚Äôve ever watched, like, 50 years ago or something, and this first video was one of the how-to episodes of MBW (I still remember the opening score along with the video, and how long it took to download, and how very jittery it was on my old computer). One of my all-time favorites.\n\nMacBreak Weekly iTunes | MacBreak Weekly RSS‚Äã\n\n18.¬†Upgrade‚Äã\n\nCo-founder of Relay.fm network Myke Hurley and his legendary co-host Jason Snell, in a heavily Apple leaning show about tech. They tend to look at all the tech scene through Apple glasses, and they do a great job spinning Apple stuff.\n\nUpgrade iTunes | Upgrade RSS‚Äã\n\n19.¬†Vector‚Äã\n\nRene Ritchie of iMore runs this (almost) daily (and sometimes twice-a-day) show about personal tech in general and Apple tech in particular. Rene is great at explaining things, and usually he gets to the bottom of whatever he‚Äôs talking about before actually talking about it.\n\nVector iTunes | Vector RSS‚Äã\n\n20.¬†Connected‚Äã\n\nA unique mix of perspectives and accents. Apple-focused, this show offers a great deal of commentary and opinions you might disagree with. Just saying :)\n\nConnected iTunes | Connected RSS‚Äã\n\nGoogle & Android\n\nGoogleverse is of course a thing, and quite a few exciting things go on in this universe at any given moment.\n\n21.¬†This Week in Google‚Äã\n\nThis actually is quite a show. It is called This Week in Google, but man, do they ever stick to the topic! I mean it as a compliment, really: tha show is broader then just Google news, and covers everything even remotely related to Google, or Google‚Äôs tech, or Google‚Äôs potential tech, or future of technology, or whatever is exciting today :)\n\nThis Week in Google iTunes | This Week in Google RSS‚Äã\n\n22.¬†Material Podcast‚Äã\n\nTwo people known for their other shows, Andy Ihnatko of MacBreak Weekly and Florence Ion of All About Android, joined forces to create Material Podcast. All things Android, with quite a bit of easygoing fire-side chatter and entertaining points of view.\n\nMaterial Podcast iTunes | Material Podcast RSS‚Äã\n\n23.¬†All About Android‚Äã\n\nAlong with Android Central‚Äôs podcast, this is probably the Android show for the Android faithful. When a bunch of people passionate about Android, get together and spill their frustrations and excitement and hopes and experiences, no matter what you think about Android, you‚Äôre in for a great show.\n\nAll About Android iTunes | All About Android RSS‚Äã\n\nMicrosoft & Windows\n\nIn recent years, Microsoft shifted a lot from a consumer-focused operating system and office software powerhouse, to a consumer and enterprise cloud and services company (with amazing consumer devices division, I must add!) In my personal opinion, this incredible turn of events doesn‚Äôt get enough love and attention, but then again, data lakes and Azure Active Directory probably have a rather narrow audience. Nevertheless, a few shows do an excellent job covering all things Microsoft.\n\n24.¬†Windows Weekly‚Äã\n\nIf you‚Äôre looking for some friendly venom from people covering Microsoft professionally, look no further. Sometimes I wonder why all the sarcasm, but then hosts go in-depth explains what‚Äôs going on, why, since when, and what‚Äôs next.\n\nWindows Weekly iTunes | Windows Weekly RSS‚Äã\n\n25.¬†This Week in Channel 9‚Äã\n\nThis is a bit meta. My colleague Christina Warren basically sums up all things Channel 9, Microsoft‚Äôs outgoing stream of news, feature update talks, tech discussions, blog posts and so on. I also recommend Channel 9 in its entirety, but be ready, it‚Äôs a lot of great content.\n\nTWiC9 iTunes | TWiC9 RSS‚Äã\n\n26.¬†Windows Central Podcast‚Äã\n\nAnother quality show around all things Windows and Microsoft. More on the consumer side, I‚Äôd say, but it doesn‚Äôt mean you don‚Äôt get a comprehensive, in-depth look inside what‚Äôs up and coming in Microsoft universe.\n\nWindows Central iTunes | Windows Central RSS‚Äã\n\nGeneral\n\nThis last category of shows is more on a general side of things, and not necessarily directly related to tech or software development. Still, these are excellent general interest shows.\n\n27.¬†Science Vs‚Äã\n\nOne of the best popular science podcasts out there. I really wished it was more regular and I definitely would like to see more episodes more often. But honestly, I‚Äôm not sure one can produce more content of this quality without sacrificing depth of the research and all the things that come in before you even begin recording.\n\nScience Vs iTunes | Science Vs RSS‚Äã\n\n28.¬†Liftoff‚Äã\n\nFor all of us space fans and enthusiasts, this is the space show. Latest news, tech advancements, plans and the reality of the space age, all the things we love and enjoy, nicely packed and unraveled by people with deep passion for space.\n\nLiftoff iTunes | Liftoff RSS‚Äã\n\n29.¬†Inside Intercom‚Äã\n\nA little bit on a corporate side of things, but nevertheless informative in general for those following SaaS and tech industry. A lot of really huge names stopped by Intercom‚Äôs virtual studios to share their journey to success.\n\nInside Intercom iTunes | Inside Intercom RSS‚Äã\n\n30.¬†99% Invisible‚Äã\n\nThis one is again a more on a general interest side of things. Still, it‚Äôs a lot of fun and inspiration, and thought-provoking conversations, neatly packed in a 30-60 minutes.\n\n99% invisible iTunes | 99% invisible RSS‚Äã",

            "id": "https://rosnovsky.us/blog/on-reading",
            "content_html": "We all read a lot without even giving it a second thought. We read the news, Facebook feeds, Twitter, Reddit, Stack Overflow, that tutorial you‚Äôve been keeping in an a tab for a weeks, text messages, you name it. If anything, we probably read more than before the interwebs, not less. The actual issue is that as a result of such reading overload we generally read way fewer books, then we used to.\n\nWhy does it even matter? I read a tutorial on how to run my own home email server, a bunch of articles about hiking (Guide to hiking the PCT or The benefits of hiking alone), an endless thread on reddit surrounding use of semicolons, a bunch of quick bits on Stack Overflow, and I‚Äôve just plowed through like 40 pages of text before lunch. Isn‚Äôt it enough? Well, in my book, this is a lot of reading, but it‚Äôs a different kind of reading, and it‚Äôs not a substitute for books. Here‚Äôs why.\n\nBooks are deliberate, well-structured, well-written, thoroughly edited, spell-checked and fact-checked blocks of consumable knowledge, that with any luck unpack so much over the course of just a few hundred pages. That‚Äôs the beauty of a book: it‚Äôs designed to provide significant amount of carefully composed knowledge. If it‚Äôs a fiction book, we are talking about a great story that puts you into this different world, paints it in such vivid colors and in such detail, that you swear you could smell the biscuits and see a sparkle of ice in gardeners eyes (he‚Äôs the murderer!), or whatever.\n\nWhen someone tries to make a book into a movie, it takes great effort to convey whatever there was in the book in a 2-hour film. Because you can‚Äôt unpack a good story in such a short period of time! You can‚Äôt get an experience of the whole world so quickly, and rightly so! It takes time to read a book, the process is deliberate; it takes effort, it takes experience, it takes work. And you need all this time to process and make this experience your own.\n\nI love reading. It takes time, so I listen to books on my commute whenever I can‚Äôt squeeze them into my day. And I can‚Äôt describe how awesome it is that people write books! There‚Äôs a book sometimes called ‚ÄúA Petition Book‚Äù (although ‚ÄúA Complaint Book‚Äù would certainly suit it better) by a a Russian fantasy writer Max Frei (pen name), where the main character has the ability to live and enjoy lives of those who complain or whine about their lives. These people don‚Äôt realize that someone just experienced their whole future lives without changing them, and all they have left is these same lives but dialed-down. The main character never physically leaves the place of the encounter; he just spends years and years of his ‚Äúvictim‚Äôs‚Äù life and ‚Äúreturns‚Äù it back, gently used: victim‚Äôs future emotions will not be as sharp, and their experiences will be bleak and dull, but they will never know the difference. It seems to me, that whenever one enjoys a good book, he or she gets to experience someone else‚Äôs life in the same manner, adding years and years of emotions, knowledge, experience and joy to their own life, but without any side effects.\n\nSo, for me, reading is a lot like living an extra life, that belongs to a different person. How cool is that? It‚Äôs not necessarily a better life, but it sure is different. Can you say that reading a good blog post or an extensive tutorial is something something along those lines? Can you, really?.. Didn‚Äôt think so :)\n\nSince books aren‚Äôt cheap, I use¬†Libby¬†as my main source for reading material. It allows you to borrow books, including latest titles and audiobooks from your local library. Yes, sometimes you have to wait a week or two for the book you want to become available, but I can totally live with that.\n\nLibby, by OverDrive - an app for library ebooks and audiobooks",

            "content_html": "I haven‚Äôt been blogging properly in like a decade, and I really miss this sometimes. So here goes.\n\nThis year my I signed up my son for school football. He‚Äôs in his last year of middle school, and had never participated in sports before. He had a encounter with Taekwando years ago, which at that point was more of a daycare then a sport for him. They had all kinds of fun, including belt promotions and demonstrations, but he really struggled with instructions, discipline and so forth. Overall, it was deemed not worth it after almost a year, and our annual contract with the club quietly expired.\n\nThis year I decided that he‚Äôs old enough to actually enjoy a team sport. He‚Äôd never been a part of a team outside of occasional group projects at school, and I was wondering if this whole football experience could brighten up he‚Äôs social experiences, not that he has any problems socializing at school or otherwise.\n\nSo, I signed him up for football practice. My expectation and hope was that he will at least move a little after school on occasion, and I hoped that he‚Äôd get to run least a little, maybe learn how to throw a ball, perhaps, learn the rules of the game so that watching it would be more enjoyable for him. Remember, I had no clue what this school football is, and thought about it more as of general exercise than an actual playing experience. Boy was I wrong!\n\nFirst shock was that he actually got a uniform. 3 sets, in fact: for training, for home games, and for away games. Then I discovered that they practice every day, not, like, once or twice a week, as I thought previously. And on top of that, they actually play against other schools, every week, starting with the second week of practice! Say what now?! And so my very never-played-sports-before son is now a football player. He knows his position, know the routes, can actually run them, can catch a ball. He doesn‚Äôt really play that much during games against other schools ‚Äî 5-10 plays tops, but he gets to go on the field, face the opposing team, do the whole routine. And I find it extremely cool! I‚Äôve been to every game he had so far, and some of them were so heated, close, and exciting!\n\nSome random observations\n\nWhen a player gets injured, whether he‚Äôs from your team or not, every other player on the field takes a knee and waits for the situation to resolve. During this season, I‚Äôve seen this happen three times; none of them were actual injuries, but the whole routine still impressed me nonetheless.\n\nAs a side note, it‚Äôs a contact sport, and as with any sport, there‚Äôs always a chance of being hit or fall or twist your ankle; with this being said, it looks like safety is one of the top concern for the coaches and the officials, and the kids are trained to keep other‚Äôs safety in mind as well\n\nTeam building is a big deal.\n\nLosing on a play, fumbling a ball, throwing an interception ‚Äî and immediately moving on to the next play. No fuming, no regrets, no time for that, next play! This is kinda cool, really. Same goes for games lost: yes, it‚Äôs an ‚ÄúL‚Äù, go home, do your homework, spend time with your family, see you tomorrow at practice.\n\nHomework, yes. There‚Äôs a grade check process in place. If you get below a certain threshold, you are suspend form participation in games (you still can go to practice, though). Vlad did fall below this threshold for a week, and missed a game. He got super motivated to get back in the game and spend that whole week making up for things he failed in class, make-up tests, working on big projects and such.\n\nAll in all, I think signing him up for football practice was one of the best decisions we made as parents. Not only did he met new friends, had this team experience, ran around quite a bit, learned how to catch a ball, and played some pretty real football games, he also discovered new things about himself as a person and got some extra motivation at school.\n\nAnd the funniest part is that 10 years ago we didn‚Äôt know football existed, and it‚Äôs only been 4 years since we watched a game for the first time :)",

I still can‚Äôt really walk well or far: I limp heavily, I can only go really slowly, walking is still very difficult for me, and walking a mile is still out of the question (it gets better every week, though; I workout, do physical therapy and such).\nSo two weeks ago I decided to give biking a shot. I mean, what could possibly go wrong, amirite? :) Last week I managed to build on that initial success, and this week I took it all to a whole new level! Not only did I commute to work this week (once, but still), but I also overcame some of my fears and rode the bike to the nearby city to get it all tuned-up and adjusted ‚Äî an almost 30-mile round trip. This is by far the farthest I‚Äôve ever traveled by a bicycle in my entire life. It gave me this amazing sense of freedom, when you sorta ‚Äúwalk‚Äù-travel: you enjoy the scenery, all the forest smells, sunshine and rain (I‚Äôve got both today!), you breathe fresh air, listen to you favorite podcasts, and workout, while actually going places at the same time! It‚Äôs just the absolutely best thing!\nNow, my bike is an eBike. It has a battery, a motor and it has 5-level Pedal Assist Systems (PAS) along with a throttle. One can use this bike without pedaling at all, or without any assistance from the motor. I‚Äôm doing something in-between: I use PAS at about level 2, and I use throttle to start faster at traffic lights. It means, that while I pedal pretty hard, I get some help from the motor, especially going uphill, and I use the motor to start faster after I come to a complete stop at an intersection or such. In this mode, the battery lasts for about 40 miles, it seems. And since I track my rides with Apple Watch, I get a pretty accurate estimate of my physical effort (hint: it‚Äôs not insignificant)\nSo although, in a way, it is not a ‚Äúpure‚Äù biking experience, I must say, if it wasn‚Äôt for the motor, I would probably never get into biking at all considering all the hills we have here and my poor physical shape. But with a little help here and there from the batter, I can now exercise outside as a normal human being.",

            "content_html": "Oh, there‚Äôs a funny story here. So, this one is from the time when we just moved to America from Canada and decided to treat ourselves to a helicopter ride. Apparently, helicopter rides are expensive. A 15-minute ride for a family of 3 cost us a few hundred dollars. Well, I thought it was ridiculous and an outrage, and decided to go to take some piloting lessons to be able to take my family on such trips whenever I want, 5-10 times cheaper. It didn‚Äôt work out exactly the way I wanted, but I did indeed had a great time flying with them in Nevada and along the Columbia River.\n\nHere‚Äôs a video from this historic helicopter ride along the Oregon coast.\n\nSeaside Helicopters is one of the only companies offering helicopter tours along the Pacific coast in Oregon. They are based off of a small amusement park just east of Seaside. You can‚Äôt really miss them: there‚Äôs a billboard, and their helicopter idling by the side of the road, hard to miss as well. The service they provide is professional, courteous, and focused on safety. For example, your weight might prevent you from taking the tour (I don‚Äôt remember exactly, but it‚Äôs something like 250 lbs tops per person). The weather could prevent you from flying as well, but being a pilot myself (albeit a student pilot), I really like this saying:\n\nAll takeoffs are optional, all landings are mandatory\n\nBasically, you‚Äôre 100% in control to take off or not. However, if you make a bad choice and fly in poor conditions, you will land, one way or the other. We were lucky, and the weather was amazing for our booking date, so we enjoyed the tour a lot. Pilots comment on what you see, point out where things are, and give you a certain freedom to decide where to go and what to see. All in all, we enjoyed the experience, even though, as I mentioned before, it cost us something in the ballpark of $300 for a 15-minute tour for two adults and a child.",
